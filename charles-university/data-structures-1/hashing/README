## Project Structure

- README          - This file
- Makefile        - Builds the programs
- main.c          - Main program execution and benchmarking
- hash-scheme.c/h - Defines cuckoo and linear probing hashing schemes
- hash-system.c/h - Defines tabulation, multiply-shift, and naive modulo hashing systems
- random-gen.c/h  - Generates random 64-bit integers
- testrandom.sh     - Runs all random tests and prints results
- testsequential.sh - Runs all sequential tests and prints results
