<h1>Data Structures I: Homework submission rules</h1>

<h2>Basic rules</h2>

<ul>

<li>The entire submission must be original code created by you without any additional "inspiration".

</li><li>Do not share your code, so that it does not become someone else's "inspiration".

</li><li>We recommend to implement given homeworks in low-level programming languages (e.g. C/C++, Pascal). Other languages can be used in exceptional cases, however this may lead to unexpected results. Please, discuss usage of other languages with your teacher.

</li><li>Given data structures and algorithms must be implemented efficiently, especially asymptotic complexity of your implementation must be as good as presented in lectures. On the other hand, a nice implementation may not be obtained by copying a pseudo-code from books or slides.

</li><li>The aim of this course is to understand the data structures and algorithms, and be able to implement them. Therefore it is not allowed to use standard nor third-party libraries in your solutions. Imagine that you have to implement given data structure in the model RAM or in assembly instructions, so use only pointers and arrays with sizes known in their allocation to access memory.
	
</li><li>Therefore, you are not allowed to used data structures vector, map, set, queue, deque and function std::sort in C++. Similar data structures cannot be used in other languages.

</li><li>On the other hand, you can use standard libraries to work with files, strings, time, etc.

</li><li>Solutions must be submitted through the submission server which will be available soon.
	
</li><li>Solutions that are not in compliance with these rules will not be evaluated.
</li></ul>

<p>
Please, use your brain to implement given problems. It is impossible to specify all details of all homeworks and to forbid all crazy ideas some students may try to do. You can always ask if you are not sure about these rules. Furthermore, your reports should describe your approach and explain reasons to do so.

</p><p>
Some homeworks may require to process huge quantity of testing data. However, your program should be able to process them in few minutes. If your program is running many hours then your implementation is inefficient or something else is done in a wrong way. For example, it is not necessary to store testing data on hard disk. Do not search for some super computer. Computers available in u-lab are sufficient.

</p><h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>Each exercise is worth <b>100 body</b>. The points will be distributed as follows:

</p><ul>
<li>20 points for the graphs
</li><li>20 points for the description
</li><li>20 points for the quality of the source code
</li><li>40 points for successful completion of the posed task
</li></ul>

<h3>Basic criteria</h3>

<ul>
<li>Solutions must meet the specifications and the code must be functional (no bugs).
</li><li>You may resubmit a corrected solution, but this will incur a penalty of 10 points for the failed attempt.
</li><li>Solutions must be submitted within the deadline (penalties: 1 point for each hour of delay).
</li></ul>

<h3>Graphs</h3>

<p>The aim is to draw a graph from which the behaviour of the specified data structures can be read. Therefore the graph must be clearly visible and all curves and axes must be labelled appropriately. Use a logarithmic scale whenever this better displays the measured data. The output of your program must contain all measured values required in problem statements. You can use arbitrary tools to create plots from measured values.


</p><h3>Description of results</h3>

<p>Explain the measured values, especially asymptotic trends and their multiplicative constants. Furthermore, compare the behaviour of different data structures, and the influences of parameters and data generators. Theoretical knowledge from lectures and exercises can be used without repeating proofs


</p><h3>Source codes</h3>

<p>Your source code will be evaluated according to the usual criteria (readability, structure, commenting ...).
