This task is a continuation of `gan` assignment, which you will modify to
implement the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).

Your goal is to modify the
[dcgan.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/dcgan.py)
template to implement a DCGAN using the embedded TODO notes. Note that
most of the TODO notes are from `gan` assignment.

After submitting the task to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`fashion`, `cifar-cars` and `mnist-data`). However, not that
you will need _a lot_ of computational power (preferably a GPU) to generate the
images.
