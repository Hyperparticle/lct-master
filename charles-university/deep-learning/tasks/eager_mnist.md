In this assignment, you will implement a simple MNIST CNN classification model
using TensorFlow Eager.

Your goal is to start with the
[eager_mnist.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/13/eager_mnist.py)
template and implement training and evaluation using Eager mode according
to the template instructions.
