In this assignment, you will implement a simple MNIST convolutional classification
model using `tf.estimator` API.

Your goal is to start with the
[estimator_mnist.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/13/estimator_mnist.py)
template and implement training and evaluation using `Estimator` according
to the template instructions.
