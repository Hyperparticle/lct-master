In this assignment you will implement a simple Generative Adversarion Network
for three datasets in the MNIST format.

Your goal is to modify the
[gan.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/gan.py)
template and implement a functional GAN using the embedded TODO notes.

After submitting the task to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`fashion`, `cifar-cars` and `mnist-data`) and maybe try
different latent variable dimensionality. The generated images are available in
TensorBoard logs.

You can also continue with `dcgan` task.
