The goal of this assignment is to try performing automatic hyperparameter
search. Your goal is to optimize [conv_net.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/13/conv_net.py)
model with several hyperparameters, so that it achieves highest validation
accuracy on Fashion MNIST dataset after **two** epochs of training.
The hyperparameters and their possible values and distributions are described
in the `ConvNet.hyperparameters` method.

Implement the search using the `skopt` package (can be installed using
`pip3 install [--user] scikit-optimize`), and print best accuracy
after **15** trials. Implement the two following strategies:
- `random_search`: use random search in the hyperparameter space
- `gp_ei`: use gaussian process approach (`skopt.gp_minimize`) with
  _expected improvement (EI)_ acquisition function

This task is evaluated manually. After you submit your solution to ReCodEx
(which will not pass automatic evaluation), write me an email and I will
perform the evaluation.
