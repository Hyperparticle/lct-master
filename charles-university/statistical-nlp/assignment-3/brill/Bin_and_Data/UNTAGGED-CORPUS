### When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines . ### Lloyd 's said there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of the market 's roughly 360 syndicates . ### The open-year accounting practice `` is widely recognized within Lloyd 's as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at Lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income , Lloyd 's said . ### The procedure causes `` great uncertainty '' because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability , Lloyd 's said . ### As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open . ### Lloyd 's said it expects to enact new rules mandating the changes by year end . ### Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably . ### In addition , officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors . ### Computer Associates International Inc. reported earnings for the second quarter , ended Sept. 30 , plummeted 66 % , primarily because of the acquisition of Cullinet Software Inc . ### The nation 's largest software company earned $ 9.6 million , or five cents a share , compared with $ 28 million , or 16 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue rose 5 % to $ 282 million from $ 268.3 million . ### The drop in earnings had been anticipated by most Wall Street analysts , but the results were reported after the market closed . ### Computer Associates closed at $ 13.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . ### Anthony Wang , president , attributed the drop to the disruption of the company 's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring Cullinet . ### The acquisition was completed in September . ### In August , the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed , and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed . ### The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products , a core area for both Computer Associates and Cullinet , as well as sales of other products as part of package sales . ### Residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit `` Cleveland 's outdoor museum '' -- Lake View Cemetery . ### Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times . ### So the inner-city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign . ### The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View 's residents . ### A spot honoring Bill White , the inventor of chewing gum , shows a woman trying to extricate her high-heeled shoe from a wad of gum . ### Another focuses on Charles Brush , the first person to light a city electrically . ### It shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp . ### Street lights , the ad points out , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . '' ### Cemetery officials hope the ads , which will begin airing next month , will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions . ### Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery . ### The private , non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts , which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots . ### `` We do n't want to be known as ambulance chasers , '' says William Garrison , Lake View 's president . ### `` We want people to think of Lake View as an historical park and educational experience . ### A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours . '' ### Not all of the cemetery 's better-known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand , however . ### For example , President James A. Garfield is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in 1881 . ### -LRB- Mr. Garrison notes , however , that the Garfield tomb is one of the nation 's premier examples of Romanesque architecture . -RRB- ### Mr. Rockefeller , buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk , did n't seem right for an ad either . ### The oil magnate , who spent his later years passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image , `` is n't terribly amusing , '' says Barry Olson , creative director at Innis-Maggiore-Olson , Canton , Ohio , which is producing the ads . ### But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View , promoters believe : Ernest Ball , for instance , who wrote `` When Irish Eyes are Smiling , '' and Garrett Morgan , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light . ### Euro Disneyland shares made a debut like Snow White yesterday while most of the London stock market looked like it had eaten the Evil Queen 's poisoned apple . ### In its first day of when-issued trading here , Euro Disney soared like Dumbo to close at 814 pence -LRB- $ 13.05 -RRB- , up 15 % from its 707-pence offering price . ### The overall London market , following Wall Street 's early nosedive , took a late beating . ### The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index plummeted 40.4 points to close at 2149.3 . ### Traders credited Euro Disney 's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the shares are destined to help finance : Walt Disney Co. 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of Paris . ### The park is slated to open in 1992 . ### `` The issue was very well-received -- Disney is such a well-known , you can say world-wide , name , '' said Vernon Dempsey , head trader of European equities at Kleinwort Benson Ltd. , which is making a market in the issue . ### Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue 's London debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares . '' ### Most of the buying was institutional , he added . ### Official trading in the shares will start in London , Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6 , when the French-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of nearly $ 1 billion , comes to market in the European Community . ### U.S. investors will be permitted to buy the shares from EC investors 90 days later . ### Because of the interest connected with the issue , the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market . ### A volatile , unofficial `` gray '' market in the shares has been operating in Paris for about two weeks . ### In contrast to the London performance , Euro Disney there closed down three francs yesterday , at 79 francs -LRB- $ 12.66 -RRB- bid , but still about 10 % over the 72-franc offering price . ### `` A lot of people are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing , '' cautioned Alistair Cuddeford , a London-based Salomon Brothers International Ltd. trader who makes a market in franc-denominated Euro Disney shares . ### `` There should be no great rush for investors to buy this . ### A lot of big European banks , mostly French , and Swiss arb accounts have been buying the stock just to flip it '' for a quick profit , he said . ### Albert Fried Jr. , a 59-year-old director and holder of a 9.5 % stake in the company , was named chairman of this maker of products for the construction equipment , material handling and railroad industries . ### He succeeds L.L. White Jr. , 62 , who resigned but continues as a director . ### Mr. Fried also is the managing partner of Albert Fried & Co . ### Ford Motor Co. intensified its battle with General Motors Corp. over Jaguar PLC by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the British auto maker when restrictions on its shareholding are lifted . ### The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . ### Ford did n't say how much it might offer for Jaguar , or when . ### The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15 % of the company 's shares without permission until Dec. 31 , ### But with its stake in Jaguar , which it raised yesterday to 11.95 % , Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner . ### A successful vote would put pressure on the British government to lift the restriction . ### `` We have not made that decision '' to seek a Jaguar special shareholders ' meeting , said Martyn Watkins , a Ford spokesman in London . ### He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . '' ### Last month , Ford announced plans to acquire as much as 15 % of Jaguar . ### Since then , Jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with GM and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month . ### Analysts have been expecting a GM-Jaguar pact that would give the U.S. car maker an eventual 30 % stake in the British company and create joint ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars . ### But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks . ### Jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving GM a minority stake , said one individual close to the talks , adding , `` It would n't surprise me if -LCB- Jaguar executives -RCB- want to wait and see what the color of that -LCB- Ford bid -RCB- is '' first . ### He predicted Ford officials will meet with Jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer . ### Sir John Egan , Jaguar 's chairman , so far has refused to meet with Ford officials , but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal . ### As for GM , its `` fallback position has to be a full bid itself , '' said Stephen Reitman , European auto-industry analyst at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew . ### A Ford takeover of Jaguar would `` have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that General Motors ca n't afford to step aside . ### They will have to throw their hat in the ring . '' ### A GM spokesman yesterday reiterated the company 's interest in acquiring a minority stake to help Jaguar remain independent . ### A pitched battle could mean Jaguar would fetch # 10 -LRB- $ 16.02 -RRB- a share , or about # 1.8 billion -LRB- $ 2.88 billion -RRB- , several analysts believe . ### The prospect of such a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks . ### U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25 % of Jaguar shares . ### In a declining London stock market yesterday , Jaguar shares were down four pence from Monday in late trading , at 694 pence -LRB- $ 11.11 -RRB- a share . ### In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading , to $ 11.25 . ### Both Ford and GM badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the European and U.S. markets . ### And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how . ### The company has expressed a preference for GM over Ford because GM has promised it would keep Jaguar independent . ### Ford 's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S . ### Then , last Friday , Ford 's talks about a possible alliance with Saab-Scania AB of Sweden collapsed . ### GM 's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market . ### Its Opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models , but it lacks Jaguar 's cachet . ### GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC , a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986 . ### Texaco Inc. reported an 11 % increase in third-quarter earnings , which it attributed partly to the company 's massive restructuring after it emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings 18 months ago . ### Sun Co. also reported higher earnings . ### Meanwhile , like many other oil companies hurt by less-profitable downstream businesses , Mobil Corp. , Shell Oil Co. and Chevron Corp. reported lower quarterly earnings . ### Texaco 's exploration and production earnings improved as a result of its streamlining of those operations as it sold many of its marginal producing properties over the past 18 months . ### An increase in production at some major oil fields in the North Sea , which had been knocked out by an explosion in July 1988 , also aided results . ### The sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to Saudi Arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business . ### `` The company has been completely revamped , '' said Frank Knuettel , analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . ### Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $ 305 million from $ 274 million last year . ### Revenue declined 3.4 % , to $ 8.4 billion from $ 8.7 billion . ### Per-share earnings declined to $ 1.10 a share from $ 1.12 a share , largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $ 1 billion of debt . ### Per-share earnings also shrank because of dividends on a new series of preferred stock . ### Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share . ### Revenue increased 11 % , to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.46 billion . ### Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of Suncor , a majority-owned Canadian subsidiary . ### Chairman Robert McClements Jr. said the synthetic crude oil production from the facility rose even as the price for that oil increased . ### Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field , a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year . ### Results declined , however , in Sun 's refining and marketing and coal businesses . ### Profits of Shell , a subsidiary of the Royal Group , tumbled $ 24 million , or 6.6 % , to $ 340 million , despite a gain of $ 30 million from an insurance settlement . ### President Frank Richardson attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices , which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of Shell 's exploration and production operation . ### away some of the gain in that unit was a decline in U.S. oil production to 502,000 barrels of oil a day during the quarter from 527,000 barrels a day last year . ### Shell 's chemical earnings fell by $ 67 million , to $ 137 million , reflecting lower margins and less demand for commodity chemicals . ### Net income at Mobil Corp. slipped 4.5 % to $ 532 million , or $ 1.30 a share , from $ 557 million , or $ 1.36 a share . ### Revenue declined $ 518 million , to $ 13.63 billion . ### Earnings included a one-time gain of $ 192 million on a property transaction in Hong Kong . ### Exploration and production profits slumped $ 40 million due to a provision for restructuring costs . ### The restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will involve the transfer and layoff of employees in U.S. operations to reduce costs and focus efforts in other areas . ### Last year , third-quarter earnings included a $ 157 million gain from foreign tax rate changes and a loss from a $ 65 million write-off of reserves . ### Chevron 's net income fell 0.7 % , to $ 417 million , or $ 1.22 a share , from $ 420 million , or $ 1.23 a share . ### Results included a $ 37 million gain from the sale of rights from Chevron 's investment in Amax Inc. , and a loss of $ 30 million from the sale of California oil and gas properties . ### Revenue rose 11 % , to $ 8 billion from $ 7.2 billion . ### Chevron said higher crude oil prices boosted profits from production operations , but margins in refining and marketing declined . ### Profits from U.S. exploration and production operations totaled $ 58 million , after the property sale loss , compared with a year-earlier $ 44 million loss that included a $ 16 million reorganization charge . ### Refining and marketing operations earned $ 130 million in the quarter this year , compared with earnings of $ 186 million a year earlier that included $ 18 million in charges for environmental programs . ### Foreign earnings fell to $ 180 million from $ 182 million that included a $ 48 million gain from lower Canadian and Australian taxes . ### Chemical profits fell to $ 78 million from $ 98 million . ### Jeff Rowe contributed to this article . ### Asarco Inc. , continuing its effort to refocus its business , ended its involvement in asbestos mining in the third quarter and said it would stop mining and selling coal by year end . ### The mining , metal and specialty-chemical concern said combined revenue for asbestos and coal was about $ 40 million of the company 's total revenue in 1988 of $ 1.98 billion . ### Richard de J. Osborne , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said the company 's `` decisions to get out of asbestos and high-sulfur coal continue the process of simplifying and focusing the company in areas with a better future . '' ### Asarco also reported third-quarter net income rose 14 % , to $ 52.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , from a restated $ 46.2 million , or $ 1.10 a share , a year earlier . ### Asarco said the gain reflected continued strength in prices for refined copper , lead and zinc , and higher equity earnings in Mexico Desarrollo Industrial Minero S.A. , a Mexican mining company in which Asarco has a 34 % stake . ### The 1988 results were restated for accounting-rules changes . ### Sales rose 4.5 % to $ 522.3 million from $ 499.4 million . ### In August , Asarco , through its Lac d'Amiante du Quebec subsidiary , sold its remaining one-third interest in an asbestos mining limited partnership in Canada for $ 11.7 million . ### Asarco said it plans to shut down or sell its Rapatee coal mine and will end its involvement in southern Illinois strip mining . ### The company said that it is discussing a management-employee buy-out of the facility , but that it would stop mining and selling coal at year end when existing sales contracts expire , regardless of the outcome of those talks . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Asarco fell $ 1.375 to close at $ 31.75 . ### Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . ### The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . ### Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . ### The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . ### Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate . ### David W.

% from June and was up 4.6 % from a year ago , according to seasonally adjusted data from the National Statistics Institute . ### The state agency , which usually publishes the data on monthly basis ,

healthy cells . ### If further experiments are successful , the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome . ### The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it . ### But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study , which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday , expressed skepticism over the significance of the results . ### And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans . ### Shin Yonehara , a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen , which is characteristic of an infected cell . ### The antibody then kills the cell . ### Dr. Yonehara and his partner , Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University , said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60 % of AIDS-infected cells within three days . ### In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said . ### Meanwhile , fewer than 10 % of the healthy cells were killed . ### The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals . ### They said they hoped to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year . ### Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said . ### The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media , and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday . ### But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . '' ### He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so would n't be killed even after exposure to the antibody . ### `` The results seem to be very premature , '' said Mitsuru Miyata , editor of Nikkei Biotechnology , a leading Japanese industry newsletter . ### Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells . ### But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects . ### `` Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose , but it can also kill other cells , '' said Dr. Yonehara . ### `` We do n't know the effect of our antibody on the human body . '' ### AIDS is n't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years , hoping to cash in on a possible cure . ### Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests . ### He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans , the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing . ### AZT is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease . ### Wellcome PLC , a major British pharmaceutical maker , sells the drug under the name Retrovir . ### A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan . ### But Andrew Porter , a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London , said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent `` a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir . ### The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission : ### American Exploration Co. , offering of five million common shares , via Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . ### Chemical Waste Management Inc. , proposed global offering of 8,500,000 shares of common stock , of which seven million of the shares will be offered in the U.S. and 1,500,000 shares will be offered overseas , via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets -LRB- domestic -RRB- and Kidder , Peabody & Co . -LRB- international -RRB- . ### Interlake Corp. , proposed offering of $ 200 million of senior subordinated debentures , via Goldman , Sachs & Co . ### InterMedia Capital Corp. , Robin Cable Systems L.P. and Brenmor Cable Partners , offering of senior subordinated discount reset debentures , via Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . ### John Nuveen & Co. , initial offerings of the Nuveen California Performance Plus Municipal Fund Inc. and the Nuveen New York Performance Plus Municipal Fund Inc. , via Alex .

'' ### In a statement , British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was `` obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up , but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue . '' ### But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue . ### Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares . ### Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors . ### `` The -LRB- paper -RRB- loss here is very small '' for these sub-underwriters , observed John Nelson , a Lazard managing director . ### In any case , he added , `` most institutions probably wo n't sell '' the bonds . ### And instead of buying the UAL stake , the U.K. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest . ### `` From a cash flow point of view , British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term , '' said Andy Chambers , an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London . ### Added another U.K. analyst : `` It gives them some cash in the back pocket for when they want to do something . '' ### For instance , British Air is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20 % stake in Sabena World Airlines , the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline . ### A definitive agreement had been expected by the end of July . ### The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on British Air shares . ### The airline 's share price already is far below the 210 pence -LRB- $ 3.33 -RRB- level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late September . ### In late trading on London 's Stock Exchange yesterday , the shares were off three pence at 194 pence . ### And because British Air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares , the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market . ### But British Air 's withdrawal from the UAL buy-out could have further repercussions . ### Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split , which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall , the carrier 's chief executive officer . ### `` The stories are rubbish , '' a British Air spokesman said . ### `` There is no difference of opinion between -LRB- Chairman -RRB- Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy . ### MINORITY RECRUITING has yet to meet hopes raised by Bush administration . ### Six months ago , as some personnel specialists saw it , a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they said was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females , blacks and other minorities . ### The perception lingers , says an official at a major industrial company . ### But so far , he declares , there 's little evidence the `` new urgency '' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring . ### `` Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity ? '' he asks . ### The recruiting `` has n't materialized , '' asserts Jeffrey Christian , who runs a search agency . ### Samuel Hall , Howard University 's placement director , also does n't see it . ### And he questions the White House dedication . ### `` I do n't think the Bush administration has done anything , '' he says . ### Recruiter Donald Clark does note an increase in searches for minority candidates . ### But some of the activity , he says , may reflect a rush to get `` numbers in order '' for end-of-year reports . ### PAY FOR PERFORMANCE hangs mostly on boss 's subjective view . ### Du Pont Co. in a couple of units has installed objective tests based on earnings or return on equity . ### Many companies have set up machinery to assure workers a fair shake . ### At most firms , though , it 's the immediate supervisor who decides the merit increases subordinates will be paid . ### Managers have `` some very broad discretion , '' says an official at Walt Disney Co . ### Unocal Corp. 's top management sets guidelines , but line supervisors slice up the merit pie . ### Lotus Development Corp. feeds its evaluations into a computer , but only for storage ; the decisions are made by supervisors . ### Hershey Foods Corp. strives for fairness by basing increases on quarterly reviews , annual appraisals and meetings with workers . ### At Chemfix Technology Inc. , each supervisor 's recommendation must be approved by the next boss up the line , and then sanctioned by a salary review committee . ### JAPANESE COMPANIES fare best in U.S. when they give Americans more say . ### University of Michigan researchers find the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning , product development and design , including decision-making back in Japan . ### `` You ca n't hire competent Americans and say , ` Let them run only their own show , ' '' says Vladimir Pucik , who headed the study run with Egon Zehnder International , a search firm . ### The researchers say many Japanese companies err in the U.S. by adopting the American practice of hiring managers on the `` open market . '' ### In Japan , by contrast , companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within . ### The Japanese also are accused of keeping their cards too close to their vests . ### `` Some Japanese executives are not yet... comfortable about sharing strategic information with their American colleagues , '' the researchers say . ### Americans stay longer with Japanese firms than American

high . ### Wafaa El-Sadr , who heads the AIDS program at New York City 's Harlem Hospital Center , ca n't find help . ### `` I 've been recruiting every single day since it 's been identified that many AIDS patients come from the inner city , '' she says . ### She was the only staff physician available to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time . ### Part of the problem , though , may reflect a general unwillingness to work with the urban poor . ### Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas says it has n't had any problem recruiting , even after a nurse contracted the virus while injecting an AIDS patient . ### `` I can tell you that nobody quit over it . ### No one panicked , '' a spokeswoman says . ### St. Paul Medical Center , also in Dallas , sees only a `` minimal erosion '' of support staff due to AIDS . ### Yale-New Haven Hospital sees no problem , says John Fenn , the chief of staff . ### `` There are enough enlightened and spirited individuals who know their responsibilities , '' he says . ### THE CHECKOFF : At least somebody gains on layoffs . ### The Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms says the industry 's volume has

Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union . ### With ballots from most of the state 's major cities in by yesterday morning , the Republicans came away with 10 % of the vote in several of the key districts . ### With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide . ### The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results . ### Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia . ### With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year 's campaign , the Republicans are seen drawing support for their `` Germans First '' stand on social-welfare issues . ### Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread . ### International investigators urged Britain to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945 . ### Under current law , such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed while not British citizens . ### `` If we 're not careful we

's car plant at Sochaux , in eastern France , voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles , a company spokesman said . ### The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage , better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses . ### The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company 's assembly plant at Mulhouse , where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80 . ### About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down . ### Striking workers , who began striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13 , had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged to reopen negotiations . ### A De Beers spokesman said yesterday the company had offered to increase the minimum wage by 18 % , while the union was demanding 26.6 % . ### Before the two parties resumed talks last week , De Beers offered 17 % and the union wanted 37.6 % . ### China 's People 's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud . ### Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the People 's Bank of China in Shenzhen , 15 major cases have been found , the paper said ; the biggest was the theft of $ 235,000 from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988 . ### The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years , with 10,000 in use , as well as 30,000 miniature models . ### But security systems , effective management controls and regulations to govern their use have not kept pace , the People 's Daily said . ### Besides money , criminals have also used computers to steal secrets and intelligence , the newspaper said , but it gave no more details . ### Japanese tourists will be told to take care when photographing earthquake damage in San Francisco , the Japan Association of Travel Agents said . ### The association issued an advisory to its 1,685 member agencies following a report from the Foreign Ministry that picture-taking by Japanese tourists in earthquake-stricken areas was causing ill feeling among local residents . ### Tass said Lenin 's tomb in Red Square will be closed from Nov. 10 to Jan. 15 for essential maintenance . ### The red granite mausoleum draws thousands of visitors daily . ### Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads . ### The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates . ### The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads , which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people . ### Since 1987 , 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates . ### `` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors -LCB- primarily to greater speed -RCB- , '' according to NHTSA . ### The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7 % between 1986 and last year , while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986 . ### In states that raised the speed limit on rural interstates , the fatality rate rose about 18 % to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988 . ### In contrast , the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 last year , the same as in 1986 . ### Well-Seasoned Reasoning -LRB- `` Food manufacturer changes spelling of ` catsup ' to ` ketchup , ' saying that 's the spelling people now prefer ''. -- WSJ Business Bulletin -RRB- ### Public preference is important , So product names should match up , And firms that find they 're lagging behind Should now take steps to ketchup -- George O.

Sterling Leiby ### Daffynition Money-making course : wad-working . -- Thomas Henry . ### In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article , `` It 's the World Bank 's Turn to Adjust , '' Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank . ### The article is , unfortunately , replete with outrageous distortions . ### One of Mr. Roberts 's observations is that the Bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries . ### This is just not so . ### The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid . ### As of June 30 , 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1 % of the Bank 's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months . ### This is an enviably low level . ### Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses . ### For the same fiscal year , by the way , the Bank 's net income was a robust $ 1.1 billion after provisions . ### Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank goes about development , financial markets have confidence in it . ### This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ 9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms . ### Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . '' ### Here , too , Mr. Roberts is way off the mark . ### The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years . ### Our traditional project loans have , for instance , supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector , sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient , autonomous agencies . ### By and large , these efforts have borne fruit . ### In my home region , Latin America , much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank . ### Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank 's adjustment lending . ### What are the facts on this type of lending ? ### The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years . ### As their name implies , these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness . ### Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector . ### Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank 's . ### Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp . ### Most recently , the Bank Group has been expanded to include the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate . ### These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government , as Mr. Roberts alleges . ### Rather , they reflect the Bank 's time-tested , pragmatic approach , which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use . ### Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa Director , External Affairs The World Bank ### The government said it would streamline its enormous and often-criticized food marketing and distribution network , Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares , or Conasupo . ### Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year . ### The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products , maintaining production of the two most important ones , corn and milk . ### Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods . ### The agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale . ### Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices . ### Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste . ### Private-sector leaders praised the Conasupo restructuring . ### But most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into Conasupo government subsidy , which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk . ### The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms . ### `` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China , '' an FDA spokesman said yesterday . ### The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination . ### On May 19 , the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi , New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms . ### In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated . ### The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus , a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables . ### A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March . ### In 1987 , China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms , valued at $ 47 million , to the U.S . ### The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants . ### A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes . ### He predicted the problem will be solved `` very soon . ### Your Sept. 26 `` Politics & Policy '' article about William Bennett 's Emergency Drug Plan for Washington gives the impression that the FBI has not been nor is actively involved . ### This is not the case . ### The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett 's initiative . ### It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI 's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our National Drug Strategy . ### Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user , but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market . ### The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department -LRB- MPD -RRB- . ### The FBI 's role is to complement the D.C. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations , but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes . ### In fact , we have agents assigned full time to assist the MPD in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence . ### Milt Ahlerich Assistant Director Office of Public Affairs Federal Bureau of Investigation ### Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28 , 1990 , the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield , N.J . ### Ramada 's previous plan was derailed by upheaval in the junk-bond market that hindered the offering of $ 400 million in high-yield securities of Aztar Corp. , the new company that will operate Ramada 's casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City , ### Under the new terms , New World will still pay $ 540 million for Ramada 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but Ramada will now reimburse New World for $ 10 million in expenses . ### Prime will still manage Ramada 's domestic franchise system when the sale closes . ### Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $ 1 in cash , subject to possible reduction , and one share of Aztar common stock . ### Shareholders will also receive one cent per share for the redemption of preferred stock purchase rights . ### The cash payout will be reduced by 40 % of any amount by which the weighted mean price of Ramada 's common stock exceeds $ 14 on the day the transaction closes . ### The provision will help provide for tax liabilities that may stem from the restructuring . ### Ramada 's stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $ 11.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading . ### The announcement dispelled some Wall Street observers ' fears that New World might demand a huge premium for the delay , or scrap the deal entirely . ### The previous deadline to complete the sale was Nov. 30 . ### One major advantage of the revised plan is that Aztar will have far less debt than under the old terms . ### `` They 'll go from being one of the most leveraged to one of the least leveraged casino companies , '' said Daniel Lee , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . ### Mr. Lee values the package at between $ 15 and $ 20 a share , based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks . ### The much-revised restructuring , which was first announced in October 1988 , must again be approved by shareholders and state casino regulators in Nevada and New Jersey . ### Financing plans include raising $ 170 million in debt secured by the company 's holdings in New Jersey . ### In May , Ramada sold its Marie Callender Pie Shops Inc. unit to a group of private investors as part of its plan to focus on its casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas and Laughlin , Nev . ### Bond prices took the high road and stock prices took the low road as worries mounted about the economy and the junk bond market . ### The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 in sluggish trading . ### But long-term Treasury bonds staged a modest rally , with prices on most issues rising about half a point , or $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount . ### The dollar sagged against other major currencies in lethargic trading . ### Traders and analysts said the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook . ### A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall . ### That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released . ### Analysts say they think durable goods orders fell about 1 % , compared with a 3.9 % gain in August , and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3 % from the second quarter 's 2.5 % . ### The stock market 's decline , coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points , surprised some investors . ### But A.C. Moore , director of research at Argus Research , said last week 's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout . ### Overall , he said , the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens . ### `` We think we 're on target in looking for renewed economic deterioration , '' he said . ### `` Corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall , and the probability is that we 'll see negative economic growth in the fourth quarter . '' ### Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he said the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market . ### In major market activity : Stock prices slumped in sluggish trading ### Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 135.9 million shares . ### Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers , 1,012 to 501 . ### Bond prices rallied . ### The yield on the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond slipped to 7.93 % . ### The dollar weakened against most other major currencies . ### In late New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen , compared with 1.8578 marks and 142.43 yen late Friday . ### The Wall Street Journal `` American Way of Buying '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization . ### The two surveys , which asked different questions , were conducted using national random probability samples . ### The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 . ### The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 . ### Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data . ### For each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 percentage points in either direction . ### The margin of error for subgroups -- for example , married women with children at home -- would be larger . ### In addition , in any survey , there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings . ### -LRB- See related story : `` The American Way of Buying : Is Buying a Car a Choice or a Chore ? -- ### Ironically , American Airlines ' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry -LRB- Sept. 20 -RRB- . ### You quote Robert Crandall , chairman of American 's parent , AMR Corp. , as having said that discount deals for big customers would be `` dumb '' because `` you will go to Detroit because you have to go to Detroit whether the fare is $ 175 , $ 275 or $ 375 . '' ### Even if Mr. Crandall is correct , he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level . ### In 1986 , he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to Braniff 's president that they both raise fares 20 % . ### -LRB- Braniff declined -RRB- . ### When I asked American Airlines for its side of the story for use in my MBA class , where I teach business ethics , it did not respond . ### Perhaps the ethics of an industry 's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry . ### Arnold Celnicker Assistant Professor Ohio State University ### Meredith Corp. is launching a new service to offer advertisers package deals combining its book , magazine and videocassette products . ### The Des Moines-based publisher said it created a new Custom Marketing Group that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines , such as Ladies Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens . ### In addition , the group will create custom-designed media such as cookbooks , newspaper inserts and videos for ad campaigns . ### Earlier this year , Meredith sold its first such package for $ 3 million to Kraft Inc. , now a unit of New York-based Philip Morris Cos . ### The Kraft package included a specially published cookbook , a national free-standing insert in Sunday newspapers , and a Kraft `` advertorial '' section that ran in five Meredith magazines . ### Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 . ### Bill Murphy , director of the new marketing unit , said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories , but he would n't disclose their names . ### Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group . ### Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction . ### The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine . ### Time Warner Inc. recently formed a `` synergy department '' to seek out ways to offer advertisers packages that could combine Time 's magazines with Warner products such as videocassettes . ### Paul DuCharme , director of media services at Grey Advertising , said Meredith is the leader in providing multimedia packages . ### `` They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together , but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan , '' he said . ### Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners . ### `` Five years ago , magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser 's big ad schedule for their magazine , '' said Mr. Murphy . ### `` But the marketplace changed . ### Advertisers now say ` Help us improve our image and extend our selling season . ' ### They are coming to publishers looking for ideas . ### Your Sept. 21 article `` It 's So Easy to Get Burned When Buying a Small Firm '' was excellent . ### I 've been advising small businesses many years and have lived with the fact that 50 % will go out of business within two years , and 80 % in five years . ### The economic loss , jobs lost , anguish , frustration and humiliation are beyond measure . ### And most of these are absolutely unnecessary . ### Your article points out the traps people fall into , but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been avoided . ### An accountant did not review the seller 's books before buying a business . ### `` I guess I was naive , '' he said . ### There is a more descriptive word to describe his lapse of common sense . ### Corporate managers who want to start their own business are the highest failure risks . ### They know all the answers and are not used to working more than 40 hours a week . ### The blue-collar worker who decides to start a business will listen and take advice . ### His humility gives him a much better chance of success . ### A few months ago your paper reported the results of a study to determine why Asians who arrive in this country without any money , and unable to speak English , become overnight successes . ### Their `` secret '' is that they gather a small group of advisers around them , listen to what they have to say , prepare a business plan and they are on their way . ### Successful American business owners do the same thing . ### Unfortunately , they are in the minority . ### Avoiding failure is easy . ### It 's unfortunate so many must learn the hard way . ### Daniel B. Scully Tucson , Ariz . ### The management turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago . ### Mr. LaBonte 's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok . ### The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives . ### The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by Reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ 1.79 billion . ### The changes come as Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc . ### The departures , said Alice Ruth , an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco , should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences . ### `` I think it 's more an issue of style . ### I would view it as a net positive . ### The company can go about its business . ### They 're in the midst of a turnaround , '' she noted . ### Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year . ### A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as Reebok did , it is going to have people coming and going . '' ### Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 . ### Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp . ### Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president . ### A spokesman said that neither Mr. Fireman nor Mr. LaBonte would be available for comment . ### `` We will not be commenting beyond the news release , '' the spokesman said . ### Mr. Goldston , who had been president of Faberge Inc. 's Faberge U.S.A. division before joining Reebok in September 1988 , left in August to pursue other interests . ### Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles . ### But even a raft of recent failures is n't stopping them from launching new publications . ### At the American Magazine Conference here , publishers are plenty worried about the industry 's woes . ### But they are also talking about new magazines . ### For example , Toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well , a new food and health magazine due out next summer . ### New York-based Hearst Corp. this fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 Months , a magazine for expectant mothers , and has already launched American Home . ### And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed at kids , on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids . ### Over the past four years , the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually , according to Donald Kummerfeld , president of the Magazine Publishers of America . ### `` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said Mr. Kummerfeld . ### `` Entrepreneurs do n't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry . '' ### And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around . ### For the first nine months , advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau increased 4 % from the same period last year , to 125,849 pages . ### Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12 % to $ 4.6 billion . ### Though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists , the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry . ### Though some magazines are thriving , the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business . ### Within the same nine months , News Corp. closed down In Fashion , a once-promising young woman 's fashion magazine , Drake Publications Inc. has folded the long-troubled Venture magazine , and Lang Communications has announced Ms. magazine , after 17 years , will no longer carry advertising as of January . ### Lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue . ### Meanwhile , American Health Partners , publisher of American Health magazine , is deep in debt , and Owen Lipstein , founder and managing partner , is being forced to sell the magazine to Reader 's Digest Association Inc . ### Mr. Lipstein 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble . ### Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as planned . ### `` The magazine is strong . ### It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. Lipstein said . ### `` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group . ### `` Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die , '' he added . ### `` Magazines could , like other brands , find that they have only a limited life . '' ### There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling . ### More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers . ### Some entrepreneurs are still active , though . ### Gerry Ritterman , president of New York-based Network Publishing Corp. , earlier this year sold his Soap Opera Digest magazine to Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . ### Mr. Ritterman said that in the next six months he will take $ 50 million from the Soap Opera Digest sale to acquire new magazines . ### He would not reveal which magazines he is considering . ### `` The magazines I am looking for are underdeveloped , '' said Mr. Ritterman . ### `` They could be old or new , but they are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved . ### They will be the next hot magazines . ### MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products . ### The price was n't disclosed , but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd. , the MCA unit , said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $ 20 million . ### The 40-year-old Buddy L concern , based in New York , designs and develops toys under the names `` Buddy L '' and `` My First Buddy , '' he said . ### MCA said it expects the proposed transaction to be completed `` no later than Nov. 10 . ### -LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB- ### FRANKLIN NATIONAL BANK DIED at 3 p.m. EDT , Oct. 8 , 1974 , and was promptly resurrected under new owners to shore up confidence in other banks during a recession . ### Arthur Burns , Federal Reserve Board chairman , said the government 's `` luck '' in keeping the bank open -- despite being the then-biggest U.S. bank failure -- prevented `` shock waves around the country and around the world . '' ### Federal officials who had been probing the bank for months arranged a merger with European-American Bank & Trust , owned by six foreign banks , to avert the closedown . ### And federal insurance protected the bank 's 631,163 depositors . ### The crisis had peaked on May 10 , 1974 , when the bank disclosed `` severe '' foreign-exchange losses due to `` unauthorized '' trading . ### Massive withdrawals followed and there was a brief rescue attempt , with political undertones , including $ 1.77 billion in Federal Reserve loans . ### Within six years many figures were convicted for their illegal abuse of Franklin funds . ### In June 1980 , Michele Sindona -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22 % block of Franklin 's stock from Loews Corp. , headed by Laurence A. Tisch -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury . ### Included was the charge that Sindona siphoned $ 45 million of Franklin funds for his other ventures . ### -LRB- Sindona in 1979 faked his `` kidnapping '' for 2 months to delay his trial . -RRB- ### During 1976 to 1979 , other former Franklin officials either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of violations including phony transactions to hide the bank 's losses . ### Sindona , the onetime Vatican financial adviser with reported links to the Mafia , died on March 22 , 1986 , at age 65 , reportedly after drinking cyanide-laced coffee in an Italian prison . ### It happened four days after he was sentenced to life in prison for ordering a 1979 murder . ### Italian magistrates labeled his death a suicide . ### In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated . ### A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as subjects with hand-held computers register their second-by-second reactions to a speaker 's remarks . ### Agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can be inferred from the subjects ' twist of a dial . ### In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped . ### Donald Vinson , who oversees the experiments , is n't some white-coated researcher . ### He heads Litigation Sciences Inc. , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate America prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions . ### In the process , Litigation Sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law . ### Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians . ### Twenty-one of its workers are Ph. D.s . ### Among other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics . ### Much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving to make the desired choice . ### With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice . ### Recently , Litigation Sciences helped Pennzoil Co. win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against Texaco Inc . ### It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League . ### And it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from Firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug Bendectin . ### Largely as a result , Litigation Sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years . ### Its 1988 revenue was $ 25 million . ### Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up . ### Mr. Vinson estimates the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million . ### In any high-stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants . ### Despite their ubiquity , the consultants are n't entirely welcome . ### Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen . ### In the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict . ### After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity . ### In real life , jurors may not always work that way , but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be programmed not to . ### Litigation consulting is , as New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller puts it , `` highly manipulative . '' ### He adds , `` The notion they try to sell is that juries do n't make decisions rationally . ### But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally . ### I find it troubling . '' ### But Mr. Zoeller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective . ### `` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it 's almost malpractice not to use them , '' he says . ### Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services . ### `` The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says Amitai Etzioni , a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University . ### Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases . ### The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark . ### In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg . ### The researchers discovered that Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury . ### The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War . ### A more blue-collar panel became a second aim . ### Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case . ### Litigation consulting had arrived . ### The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case . ### The problem for IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies was how to make such a highly technical case understandable . ### As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them . ### The solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury demographically , sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him . ### He then briefed Messrs. Boies and Barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly . ### Thus , the `` shadow '' jury was born . ### Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences . ### -LRB- IBM won the case . -RRB- ### `` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine & Moore . ### `` What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it . ### A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . '' ### The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which Energy Transportation Systems Inc. sued Santa Fe Pacific Corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over . ### Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow . ### Just before the actual closing arguments , the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors , each of whom was being paid $ 150 a day . ### The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages . ### The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for Energy Transportation . ### `` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' says Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins . ### `` It 's often wrong , but it 's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer . '' ### Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work . ### Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters . ### And to the uninitiated , some of the firm 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative . ### Theoretically , jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively . ### Instead , Mr. Vinson says , interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views . ### Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror . ### If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant them . ### Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal , Litigation Sciences advises . ### So would someone recently divorced or widowed . ### -LRB- Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . -RRB- ### For personal-injury cases , Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve . ### Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women . ### The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books . ### Litigation Sciences does n't make moral distinctions . ### If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them . ### As Mr. Vinson explains it , `` We do n't control the facts . ### They are what they are . ### But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ . ### In our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . '' ### Once a jury is selected , the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly . ### Logic plays a minimal role here . ### More important are what LSI calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level . ### In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish . ### By repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman 's injuries . ### The ploy worked . ### The defense won . ### In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame . ### `` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight , '' Mr. Vinson has written . ### Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in Litigation Sciences ' operation . ### Studies show , the consultants say , that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually . ### Computer-generated videos help . ### `` The average American watches seven hours of TV a day . ### They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer . ### Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this . ### Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics . ### `` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it , '' says Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics expert at New York University law school . ### `` What you have here is intuition made manifest . '' ### Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence . ### Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage . ### Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome . ### Litigation Sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions . ### A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -LRB- not at Litigation Sciences -RRB- $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine . ### Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick . ### `` The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation , '' says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co . ### He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . '' ### But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken . ### And the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage . ### For more than a decade , Mr. Etzioni , the sociologist , has been a leading critic of the masseurs . ### `` There 's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately , '' he says . ### `` But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better . ### What you then do is you make them think inappropriately . '' ### To hamper the work of litigation scientists , he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do n't require explanations . ### In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges . ### For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more . ### Mr. Etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors . ### -LRB- Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors . -RRB- ### Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities . ### Even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact . ### Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors . ### `` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. Boies says . ### Silicon Graphics Inc. , a fast-growing maker of computer workstations , said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $ 100 million over the next five years . ### One award is part of a Department of Defense contract to Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers and could be valued at more than $ 100 million over five years . ### The other involves the sale of about 35 of the company 's high-end workstations to the National Institutes of Health . ### The models , which cost about $ 75,000 each , will be used in research . ### The awards are evidence that Silicon Graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers , analysts said . ### `` The company 's on a roll , '' said Robert Herwick , an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist . ### `` No other -LCB- computer -RCB- vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price . '' ### In the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers , most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors : Sun Microsystems Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp. , which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs . ### Silicon Graphics , on the other hand , has targeted a specific niche since its inception in 1982 , which has been dubbed by some as `` motion-picture computing . '' ### This is a style of `` visual '' computing that provides three-dimensional , color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion . ### Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than Digital , Hewlett and Sun , it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market . ### In addition , the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices . ### A year ago , Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced at $ 15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features . ### Silicon Graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future . ### `` It 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30 % to 40 % a year , '' said Edward McCracken , the company 's chief executive officer . ### Silicon Graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off . ### Revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 86.4 million , a 95 % increase over the year-ago period . ### Profit was $ 5.2 million , compared with $ 1 million for the year-ago quarter . ### Remember those bulky , thick-walled refrigerators of 30 years ago ? ### They , or at least something less efficient than today 's thin-walled units , may soon be making a comeback . ### That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators . ### These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol , signed by 24 nations in 1987 . ### In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- . ### World-wide production would be cut in half by 1998 . ### The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 . ### Not to be outdone , George Bush wants CFCs banished altogether by the year 2000 , a goal endorsed at an 80-nation U.N. environmental meeting in Helsinki in the spring . ### That 's a lot of banishment , as it turns out . ### CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas , often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon , which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment . ### Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation . ### Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator , which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber . ### But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it . ### They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . ### Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . ### Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs . ### In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . ### `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan . ### `` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently . ### But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon , before all the evidence is in . ### We ca n't afford to wait . '' ### But does it have to be so soon ? ### Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century . ### It 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S . ### Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer . ### It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere , the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone . ### But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture . ### The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure . ### What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year . ### But it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in Antarctica . ### Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems , running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping . ### Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available , why not use them ? ### Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs . ### Butane and propane can be used as coolants , for example , but are flammable . ### Moreover , new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations , which , as with CFCs , are solvents . ### Mr. Teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices , energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect . ### Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it , but let 's not be flippant about grave risks . ### As it happens , Arthur D. Little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories . ### It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs . ### There is , after all , big money in environmentalism . ### Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs . ### Freon , introduced in 1930 , revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all . ### One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way . ### Du Pont , as it happens , has a potential substitute for CFCs . ### Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it . ### Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets , of course . ### There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise . ### Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it . ### University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . '' ### They needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts . ### In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few . ### That tends to tilt the public debate toward `` solutions '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency . ### There is an element of make-work involved . ### Consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car . ### If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap . ### But if there is no impending threat , it can get to be very expensive . ### but worries about 1990 . ### With most legislatures adjourned for the year , small business is tallying its scorecard . ### Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans . ### While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes Don L. Robinson , associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest small-business organization . ### Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated . ### Oregon 's rate will rise to $ 4.75 an hour , the nation 's highest , in Jan. 1 , 1991 . ### Iowa 's will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 an hour in January 1992 -- but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate . ### In 17 central states , one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave . ### The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams . ### Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year . ### `` Those kinds of issues always keep coming back , '' says Robert Beckwith , who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small-business office . ### DESPITE VICTORIES this year , small business fears losing parental-leave war . ### Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants . ### Similar proposals were defeated in at least 15 other states . ### But small business , which generally detests government-mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes . ### `` It 's just a matter of time before the tide turns , '' says one Midwestern lobbyist . ### Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves . ### In Pennsylvania , small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt . ### They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave . ### In 1990 , the issue is expected to be especially close in Alaska , California , Michigan , New York , Pennsylvania and Illinois . ### `` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the Midwest and Northeast , '' says Jim Buente of the NFIB . ### IN LOS ANGELES , more small businesses ponder adopting a child-care policy . ### Triggering the re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees . ### The preferential treatment even applies to awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 and consulting and temporary services -- which often go to the smaller concerns . ### Firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide . ### Council member Joy Picus , the measure 's chief advocate , considers it part of a `` pro-family policy '' that makes Los Angeles a leader in `` humanizing the workplace . '' ### NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that especially affect small business . ### In San Francisco , small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $ 95 million downtown baseball stadium ; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business . ### But in Washington state , small business generally opposes an initiative to boost spending on children 's programs by $ 360 million , fearing the state 's 7.8 % sales tax will be raised to finance the outlays . ### DIALING DOLLARS : Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area-code switch Nov. 11 -- to 708 from the familiar 312 -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers . ### Wessels & Pautsch , a small St. Charles law firm , plans to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers ' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards . ### But many owners plan to practice frugality -- crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out . ### Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville wo n't discard his old supply . ### -LRB- He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . -RRB- ### CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy . ### With some new rules , state officials say they made it easier -- and faster -- to sell new franchises whose terms stray from those in state-registered contracts . ### Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking at least six weeks . ### Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be pre-registered . ### For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . '' ### Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ 1 million , $ 200,000 annual income , or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold . ### But critics consider the changes regressive . ### Lewis G. Rudnick , a Chicago lawyer who represents franchisers , contends California is narrowly limiting -- rather than expanding -- opportunities for negotiating sales . ### He argues California regulators historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along . ### San Francisco lawyer Timothy H. Fine , who represents franchisees , insists California 's cautiousness helps protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who push unlawful clauses . ### SMALL TALK : A new Maryland law frees store owners of liability if a customer trips or otherwise gets hurt on the way to the restroom . ### Only 4 % of Missouri small businesses surveyed say they 've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use . ### By 52%-36 % , Tennessee NFIB members favor laws to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in the state . ### About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday . ### In other words , it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute . ### City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday 's earthquake . ### The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south . ### It will take several weeks to repair the bridge , and several months to repair some of the 101 connections . ### But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal . ### For the first time in memory , it was standing-room only in BART 's sleek , modern railcars . ### Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping . ### Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours , or that many workers are still staying at home . ### Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations . ### In the best of times , the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more . ### Not that getting into town was easy . ### Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to BART 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn . ### Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan . ### Her commute from Petaluma , Calif. , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via the Golden Gate Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area . ### Yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district . ### `` It 's worse than I thought , '' she said . ### `` I do n't know where all the buses are . '' ### But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate , by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out . ### `` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said Charles Catania , an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County . ### `` It looks like a holiday . ### I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . '' ### However , a spokeswoman for BankAmerica Corp. said yesterday 's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day . ### At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved . ### `` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said Stan Perez , a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol . ### There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role . ### The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush . ### Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work . ### Of Bechtel 's 17,500 employees , about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay . ### Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m . ### The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of PG&E employees working conventional 9-5 hours , a spokesman says . ### Some of the utility 's employees may opt for a four-day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % . ### At Pacific Telesis Group , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business hours , a spokeswoman says . ### Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock . ### One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay . ### But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last . ### Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate . ### And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways . ### Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can . ### Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position . ### Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack . ### And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster . ### Well , mankind can rest easier for now . ### Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected . ### And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome . ### As if he were Iron Mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years . '' ### His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed . ### `` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said . ### The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T. 's strong points . ### Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions . ### D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall , in the New York Academy of Art . ### In fact , D.T. never left home , Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link . ### They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov , but they put their hope in D.T. 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 . ### But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite . ### This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded . ### No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones . ### After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 . ### But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly . ### Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on move 16 . ### `` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans . ### By move 21 , D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap . ### It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T. 's knights . ### Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T. 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity . ### Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it . ### Consistently , D.T. was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form . ### When most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down . ### Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision . ### While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost . ### He also launched a kingside storm , sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T. 's king . ### No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T. ### A piece down , the computer resigned . ### Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two . ### With the advantage of playing white -LRB- which moves first -RRB- , Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted . ### As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight . ### This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development . ### `` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later . ### In such positions , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . '' ### After only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky . ### Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack . ### And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats . ### Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move . ### Now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination . ### On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play . ### Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly . ### He won D.T. 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , to give the computer much hope . ### In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move . ### And Mr. Kasparov , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room . ### `` In both games I got exactly what I wanted , '' he said . ### What he had demonstrated , he added , is that there 's more to chess than sheer calculation . ### Undeterred , D.T. 's handlers vowed to press on . ### Indeed , three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp . ### Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu : `` In three years we 'll mount a better challenge . '' ### Mr. Tannenbaum is a reporter in the Journal 's New York bureau . ### Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in . ### Just ask Richard Blumenfeld , a New Jersey dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . '' ### In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % . ### `` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. Blumenfeld recalls . ### Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % . ### The CD seemed like a great deal . ### But nearly 3 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 . ### The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD . ### Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value . ### The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return . ### More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market . ### Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value . ### Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance . ### The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month . ### Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured . ### `` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says . ### He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds . ### Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique . ### Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk . ### `` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says John Markese , research director of the American Association of Individual Investors , a Chicago-based educational group . ### `` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . '' ### Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying . ### He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch . ### But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks . ### The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York . ### Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale . ### The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference... is not insured . ### Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . '' ### Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium . ### `` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says . ### Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid . ### -LRB- Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 . -RRB- ### `` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc . ### `` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks . ### `` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . '' ### Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years . ### Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 . ### Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total . ### Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs . ### Still , there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding . ### Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education . ### Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity . ### But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured . ### People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed . ### However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid . ### Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate . ### Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved . ### And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself . ### No one else will watch out for you . ### Americans are drinking less , but young professionals from Australia to West Germany are rushing to buy premium-brand American vodka , brandy and other spirits . ### In particular , many are snubbing the scotch preferred by their parents and opting for bourbon , the sweet firewater from the Kentucky countryside . ### With U.S. liquor consumption declining steadily , many American producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad . ### And those efforts are paying off : Spirits exports jumped more than 2 times to $ 157.2 million in 1988 from $ 59.8 million in 1983 , according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. , a trade group . ### `` Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers , '' says Michael Bellas , president of Beverage Marketing Corp. , a research and consulting firm . ### `` If you want to be a player , you have to be in America , Europe and the Far East . ### You must have world-class brands , a long-term perspective and deep pockets . '' ### The internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies ' acquisitions of many U.S. producers . ### In recent years , for example , Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain acquired Heublein Inc. , while another British company , Guinness PLC , took over United Distillers Group and Schenley Industries Inc . ### But the shift has also been fueled by necessity . ### While premium-brand spirits like Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniel 's whiskey are riding high in the U.S. , domestic spirits consumption fell 15 % to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979 . ### In recent years , growth has come in the foreign markets . ### U.S. brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons , a standard industry measure , according to Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group , an industry association . ### Exports of rum surged 54 % to 814,000 proof gallons . ### Mexico is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S . ### Japan , the world 's third-largest liquor market after the U.S. and Britain , helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products . ### California wineries , benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies , are expanding aggressively into Japan , as well as Canada and Great Britain . ### In Japan , the wineries are promoting their products ' Pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs , whose recommendations carry weight . ### In Australia , Britain , Canada and Greece , Brown-Forman Corp. has increased its marketing of Southern Comfort Liqueur . ### Using cinema , television and print ads , the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum American South . ### The biggest foreign inroads , though , have been made by bourbon . ### While U.S. makers of vodka , rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad , trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon . ### -LRB- All bourbon comes from Kentucky , though Jack Daniel 's Tennessee whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste . -RRB- ### Moreover , just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U.S. , bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries , a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore . ### How was the West won ? ### With a six-shooter in one hand and bourbon in the other . ### `` We imagine with bourbon the Wild West , Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing , '' says Kenji Kishimoto , vice president of Suntory International Corp. , a division of Suntory Ltd. , Japan 's largest liquor company . ### Suntory distributes Brown-Forman bourbons in Japan . ### Bourbon makes up just 1 % of world-wide spirits consumption , but it represented 57 % of U.S. liquor exports last year , according to Jobson ; no other category had more than 19 % . ### Big U.S. distillers are fiercely vying for this market , which grew to $ 77 million last year from $ 33 million in 1987 , according to government figures . ### Jim Beam Brands Co. , a division of American Brands Inc. , is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor . ### The company says it will increase its international advertising 35 % in 1990 , with bourbon representing most of that amount . ### Guinness 's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout Asia , enabling it to install prominent counter displays . ### The company 's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in Japan , with 40 % of the market . ### Bourbon exporters have succeeded in Japan where other industries have failed , avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by allying themselves with local agents . ### Jim Beam Brands has a distribution partnership with Nikka Whiskey Co. , a distiller . ### Seagram Co. , which exports Four Roses bourbon , has such a link with Kirin Brewery Co . ### Some bourbon makers advertise abroad as they do at home . ### To promote Jack Daniel 's overseas , Brown-Forman uses the same photos of front porches from Lynchburg , Va. , and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops . ### Jim Beam print ads , however , strike different chords in different countries . ### In Australia , land of the outback , a snapshot of Jim Beam lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather . ### West Germans get glitz , with bourbon in the foreground and a posh Beverly Hills hotel in the background . ### Ads for England are artsy and irreverent . ### One ad features a huge robot carrying a voluptuous woman in a faint . ### The tagline : `` I only asked if she wanted a Jim Beam . ### Capital Inc. 's net income rose 29 % on a modest 9 % increase in revenue in the third quarter , mainly on strong advertising demand at its ABC television network operation . ### Demand for ads also rose at the eight TV stations Capital Cities owns and at its 80%-owned ESPN sports cable channel . ### The broadcast and publishing company reported net climbed to $ 80.8 million , or $ 4.56 a share , from $ 62.6 million , or $ 3.55 a share , in the year-earlier period . ### Revenue reached $ 1.1 billion from $ 1.01 billion . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Capital Cities closed at $ 558.50 , down $ 5 . ### The broadcasting unit reported operating profit of $ 134.9 million , up 18 % from the year-earlier $ 114.3 million . ### Publishing reported operating profit was $ 33.3 million , nearly flat with the year-before $ 33 million . ### Revenue at the broadcasting unit , consisting of the network and stations , advanced 11 % , to $ 838 million from $ 752.9 million . ### The publishing unit reported revenue edged up 2.6 % to $ 263.2 million from $ 256.6 million . ### Chairman Thomas S. Murphy cited Capital Cities ' nine daily newspapers in explaining most of the gain . ### The parent also publishes weeklies , shopping guides and specialty magazines . ### For 1989 's first nine months , Capital Cities net income grew 23 % to $ 303.7 million , or $ 16.97 a share , from $ 246.9 million , or $ 14.43 a share . ### Revenue eased 0.3 % to $ 3.45 billion from $ 3.46 billion . ### Last week , ABC unseated General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit as the No. 1 network , as rated by A.C. Nielsen Co . ### ABC has four shows in the top 10 , including the top show , `` Roseanne . ### As part of a previously announced transaction , Federal Mogul Corp. has bought approximately 565,000 shares of its common stock from Nortek Inc. at $ 23.50 a share . ### Nortek has agreed not to acquire any securities of Federal-Mogul for 10 years and not to influence company affairs during that period . ### Weyerhaeuser Co. said it sold its wall-paneling business to an affiliate of one of Indonesia 's largest wood-products firms . ### Terms of the transaction were n't disclosed . ### Weyerhaeuser said its paneling business employs about 300 workers at two facilities in Chesapeake , Va. , and Hancock , Vt . ### Manville Corp. said it will build a $ 24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil . ### The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill 's energy costs . ### Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991 . ### Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called on the Federal Reserve System to lower interest rates . ### In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , Mr. Kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the Fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . '' ### `` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said . ### The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 % from about 9 % . ### Bush administration officials say inflation is under control . ### With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further . ### But for the most part , officials have avoided expressing those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed . ### McDonald 's Corp. said third-quarter earnings rose 14 % on a hefty sales gain , but domestic franchisees apparently did n't partake of the improvement . ### The world 's largest fast-food chain said net income rose to $ 217.9 million , or 59 cents a share , from $ 191.3 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago . ### In the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level . ### Revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.46 billion . ### Systemwide sales , which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores , totaled $ 4.59 billion compared with $ 4.2 billion . ### But sales for U.S. franchisees were flat at best on a per-store basis despite weak 1988 figures . ### Compared with the first nine months of last year , average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly $ 3,200 , reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food chains . ### Since McDonald 's menu prices rose this year , the actual decline may have been more . ### McDonald 's closed at $ 31.375 , up $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . ### While franchisees were having a tough time holding sales , McDonald 's company-operated stores posted hefty gains for the nine months , with sales per company-operated unit rising $ 20,000 . ### One analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees , thus aiding promotional efforts . ### On average in the latest nine months , company-operated units in the U.S. had $ 90,552 more in sales than did franchised outlets . ### There are more than three times as many franchised domestic outlets as there are company stores . ### Profit margins at U.S. company-owned stores in the quarter were up nearly 1 % , which the company attributed in part to lower food costs . ### Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Leslie Steppel said reduced labor costs helped boost margins , although she doubted `` that kind of performance is sustainable . '' ### Calling sales `` still relatively soft , '' Ms. Steppel believes that in real terms , U.S. sales slipped 3 % to 4 % at company-operated stores in the quarter . ### Apparently acknowledging weaker U.S. sales systemwide , McDonald 's vowed `` to use our size and muscle to do all that is necessary to build the brand . '' ### Overseas , both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago . ### Third-quarter sales in Europe were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company 's earnings . ### McDonald 's said that systemwide sales would have been $ 115 million greater had 1988 exchange rates remained in effect . ### `` Going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult , '' predicted restaurant analyst Howard Hansen of Kidder , Peabody & Co . ### Reflecting better growth prospects abroad , McDonald 's noted that as of Sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago , while the opposite was true for domestic expansion . ### At the end of the third quarter McDonald 's had 10,873 units operating world-wide . ### In the nine months , earnings rose 12 % to $ 555.6 million , or $ 1.49 a share , from $ 494.4 million , or $ 1.31 a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue rose 11 % to $ 4.56 billion from $ 4.12 billion . ### Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships . ### The Miami-based company 's stock fell $ 1.75 yesterday to $ 20.75 a share in heavy American Stock Exchange composite trading . ### Early yesterday , Carnival said in a company statement that it had been `` notified unofficially '' that Waertsilae Marine Industries , the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy . ### Officials at Carnival declined to comment . ### `` There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said John P. Uphoff , an analyst at Raymond James Associates Inc . ### `` I did n't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy . '' ### Carnival said the `` Fantasy , '' the first of the three $ 200 million ships that Carnival has on order , is scheduled to be delivered next month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean . ### That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of Carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % . ### The second ship , which is half-completed , is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 . ### `` There 's a 99 % chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule , '' said Caroline Levy , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . ### `` The others will probably be delivered as well , but Carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . '' ### She said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships . ### If the ships are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the 1990 fiscal year , which begins Dec. 1 . ### Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 . ### If the ship fails to arrive , those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more . ### Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits . ### Normally , a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction . ### Carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for Fantasy . ### Some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it . ### According to reports from Finland , Waertsilae Marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate Oy Waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees . ### The shipyard disclosed in mid-August that it expected losses stemming from a series of unprofitable orders . ### Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection , saying that her cash flow had been cut off . ### The designer , whose line of modular , one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones , has been in a dispute with her latest licensee , Jerell Inc. for several months . ### Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March . ### The designer 's attorney , Molly Bartholow , said that Ms. Garratt was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because Jerell began withholding her royalty payments last month . ### Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known as Multiples by Sandra Garratt , which are sold primarily through department stores . ### Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year , charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs , in violation of their contract . ### That lawsuit is still pending . ### Jerell could n't immediately be reached for comment . ### Ms. Garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed . ### Eaton Corp. had a 26 % drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single business . ### Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer . ### He declined to make a specific earnings estimate . ### Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago . ### Sales rose 2.8 % to $ 864.1 million , from $ 840.4 million . ### The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said Patrick E. Sheridan , analyst with McDonald & Co . ### Mr. Sheridan , who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ 1.25 a share , says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ 5.70 a share , from his previous estimate of $ 6.10 . ### Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report . ### He said Eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated . ### Eaton said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million . ### Sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose . ### Eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million . ### Mr. Hardis said truck-fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behaves . ### The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral . ### Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million . ### The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market . ### For the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago . ### Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier . ### Nine-month sales were $ 2.79 billion , up 8.2 % from $ 2.58 billion a year earlier . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Eaton closed at $ 57.50 a share , down $ 2.50 . ### In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics . ### Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month . ### The conference , held in Lower Silesia , was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Polish Ecological Club , and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry , as well as Hungarians , Czechs , Russians , Japanese and Americans . ### The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior . ### Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding Poland 's lack of functioning markets . ### Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ? ### The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation . ### Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance . ### According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey Institute , 27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards . ### Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions . ### Four-fifths of Poland 's soils have become highly acidified ; 70 % of its southern forests are projected to die by century 's end . ### Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled . ### Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe . ### Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average . ### Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP . ### Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West . ### They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions . ### The solutions they formally proposed included taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps . ### But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control . ### A revolution takes more than conference manifestos . ### Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference : `` The world must be coming to an end . ### The Russians are talking peace . ### The Palestinians are talking elections . ### And the Poles are engaged in commerce . '' ### But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year . ### Those implications include : -- Privatization ### Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance . ### Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries . ### But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects . ### -- Least-cost solutions . ### As conferees noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms . ### That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk . ### It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees . ### That 's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals . ### -- Creative financing . ### Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars . ### New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland 's hard-currency reserves . ### -- Democratization . ### East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets . ### While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information . ### For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose . ### -- Global reciprocity . ### One participant prematurely declared that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while Poland represents the opposite . ### His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer . ### At the moment , Poland resembles 19th-century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness . ### But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy . ### Mr. Levin , former head of EPA 's regulatory reform staff , adapted this from his November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association . ### Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of Apple Computer , Intel and many other computer-related concerns . ### The drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an 0.7 % slide by the Nasdaq composite index . ### It finished at 467.22 , down 3.45 . ### The nervousness about the technology stock outlook also hurt the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which slipped about 1 % . ### Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC 's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52 . ### The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2.38 to 458.32 . ### Some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors . ### But Charlie Howley , vice president in charge of OTC trading at SoundView Financial in Stamford , Conn. , said the selling was orderly . ### `` It 's a quiet retreat , '' said Mr. Howley . ### `` It 's nothing dramatic , just a routine sell-off . '' ### Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies , he said . ### But some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues . ### Yesterday 's volume of 117.2 million shares was far below last week 's sizzling average of nearly 177 million . ### For October so far , daily volume is averaging 150.3 million , putting it on track to be the year 's busiest month . ### Apple Computer , which reported lackluster earnings Friday , lost 1 to 46 on 1.1 million shares . ### Stratus Computer , which reported earnings late Friday that were in line with a disappointing forecast , eased to 24 on 816,000 shares . ### Investors apparently did n't like the news from Rainbow Technologies either . ### It said net income was 17 cents a share in the third quarter , compared with 16 cents a share a year earlier . ### Rainbow 's stock dropped 2 to 14 . ### Other technology stocks that were weaker included Intel , which fell 1 to 33 on 1.9 million shares , Mentor Graphics , down to 16 on 1.6 million shares , Sun Microsystems , which slipped to 18 , and MCI Communications , down 1 to 42 . ### Microsoft , which last week rose to a record , fell victim to profit-taking , traders said , as it declined 2 to 83 . ### Conner Peripherals was unchanged at 15 . ### Among takeover stocks , Jefferson Smurfit jumped 1 to 42 after SIBV-MS Holdings said the price to be paid to Jefferson Smurfit 's minority holders has been raised to $ 43 a share . ### The increase of $ 1.25 a share is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to SIBV-MS 's tender offer . ### SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership . ### The Jefferson Smurfit affiliate , Smurfit International B.V. , holds about 78 % of the shares outstanding . ### These shares will be bought by SIBV-MS Holdings at $ 41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares . ### Another takeover target , LIN Broadcasting , eased to 110 on 313,800 shares . ### LIN 's suitor , McCaw Cellular Communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares . ### Some analysts say investors will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointments . ### They say investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15 % to 20 % . ### That would be good news for the OTC market , some analysts say , because many small growth stocks are traded there . ### Michael R. Weisberg , partner in charge of research at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco , said some investors have already made the switch . ### The Robertson Stephens Index of 340 emerging growth stocks is up 23.1 % for the year through Friday . ### The rise matches that of the Dow Jones industrials this year . ### `` It 's been a spectacular year for the emerging growth stock investor , '' Mr. Weisberg said . ### He predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with `` some kind of unique product or franchise '' that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum . ### He puts the OTC market 's Nellcor , Office Club and BizMart on the list . ### Nellcor , a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems , was up to 16 on 258,000 shares yesterday , while retailing issue Office Club was unchanged at 10 on 65,200 shares . ### BizMart , another retailing stock , was off to 8 on nearly 80,000 shares . ### Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session . ### Payco American , a credit collection concern , jumped 1 to 20 on volume of 93,000 , and Mail Boxes Etc. , a private postal services company , advanced to 23 on volume of 64,000 . ### But Legent , a systems software stock , was down to 29 on 39,300 shares . ### Novell , a computer networking concern , fell 1 to 30 on 152,000 shares . ### Elsewhere , Valley National continued its slide , dropping 2 to 15 on 1.7 million shares . ### The Arizona banking concern is facing difficulties related to weakness in the real estate market in the state . ### Higher earnings helped some issues . ### Amgen rose 2 to 54 on almost 800,000 shares , and CVB Financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares . ### Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ? ### It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do . ### It 's that we do n't want to . ### And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests . ### These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them . ### Here is an example . ### If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course . '' ### But what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity '' ? ### No one can say . ### In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem . '' ### The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves . ### The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was -LRB- and is -RRB- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was -LRB- and is -RRB- regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children . ### It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive . ### Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands . ### Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy . ### American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share . ### The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way . ### The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated . ### `` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction . ### It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results . ### It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy . ### I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher . ### They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses . ### But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment . ### I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching . ### They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition . ### But they need not be to do their jobs well . ### Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days . ### But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious . ### In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor . ### If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place . ### If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well . ### Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis . ### Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem . ### It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more . ### It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes . ### It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency . ### But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials . ### If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it . ### If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do . ### There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message . ### Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand . ### We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking . ### In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned . '' ### They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them . ### Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five . '' ### A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need . ### What Gov. Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years . ### Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program . ### We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away . ### Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea . ### Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children . ### Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school . ### They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card . ### If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another . ### -- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea . ### Here , the experience of New York City is decisive . ### Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians . ### New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it . ### -- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better . ### The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal . ### Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons . ### The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers . ### There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures -LRB- in real terms -RRB- have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined . ### That is the way the system works . ### -- Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows . ### No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago . ### This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish -LRB- though that is clearly desirable -RRB- than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work . ### The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd . ### The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential . ### No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential . ### -- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than newer ones . ### The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial . ### They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience . ### One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods . ### Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson -LRB- himself a recent math major at Harvard -RRB- in the November American Spectator . ### -- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline . ### Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head . ### With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability . ### Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance . ### This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it . ### Mr. Kristol , an American Enterprise Institute fellow , co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The National Interest . ### International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other . ### The company unveiled more than 50 products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning . ### The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations . ### Manufacturers have already spent so heavily on automation that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources . ### But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools . ### IBM 's announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to customers today , also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated and where Hewlett-Packard Co. has recently gained market share . ### Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter . ### Sam Albert , a consultant in Scarsdale , N.Y. , said that in the past IBM has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines . ### He said he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology . ### He said he expects IBM to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months . ### IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing . ### Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors , IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs . ### IBM 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems . ### IBM can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents . ### `` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said George Conrades , IBM 's top marketing official . ### Japan 's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August . ### Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 . ### As a result , brokerage house officials said , appropriate comparisons from the same period a year earlier were unavailable . ### Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period . ### The statistics follow a year-on-year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989 , recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash . ### Nomura said its pretax profits inched up 0.9 % to 248.91 billion yen -LRB- US$ 1.75 billion -RRB- from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31 . ### Total operating profit fell 3.1 % to 486.1 billion yen from 501.61 billion yen . ### Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen . ### Per-share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen . ### Daiwa said its pretax profits surged 9.6 % to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term . ### Operating profit rose 5.5 % to 332.38 billion yen from 315.12 billion yen . ### Net income jumped 21 % to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen . ### Per-share net rose to 62.04 yen from 51.50 yen . ### Yamaichi said its pretax profit increased 8.9 % to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen . ### Operating profit rose 5.3 % to 279.75 billion yen from 265.79 billion yen . ### Net income surged 21 % to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen . ### Per-share net rose to 47.46 yen from 39.31 yen . ### Nikko 's pretax profit rose 1.6 % to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen . ### Operating profit rose 4 % to 293.29 billion yen from 282.08 billion yen . ### Net income rose 23 % to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen . ### Per-share net rose to 44.08 yen from 36.13 yen . ### Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 . ### Harken , which made its offer in August , said it still is awaiting a response to its offer from Tesoro 's board . ### Harken also said that its financing from Bankers Trust Co. has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro 's board time to consider the offer at a Tesoro board meeting scheduled for mid-November . ### Harken , which owns about 800 retail gas stations , has said it is particularly interested in Tesoro 's refinery because it would fill a gap in its business . ### However , Tesoro , based in Houston , already has rejected a suitor in the past year . ### Francis D. John , 35-year-old president , will assume the additional job of chief executive officer . ### He succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman . ### National Environmental also said it will move its headquarters from Hingham to Folcroft , Pa. , the site of its sludge dewatering facility . ### National Environmental , formerly Yankee Cos. , is a sludge treatment company . ### Eagle Clothes Inc. , which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , said it reached an agreement with its creditors . ### Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer . ### Mr. Roth , who has been on leave from his posts , will be succeeded by Geoffrie D. Lurie of GDL Management Inc. , which is Eagle 's crisis manager . ### Mr. Lurie is currently co-chief executive . ### Arnold Levine , acting co-chief executive , will continue as senior vice president and a board member . ### Eagle also said it received a commitment for as much as $ 8 million in financing from Norfolk Capital Group Inc . ### In addition , a Norfolk affiliate , York Capital Inc. , will purchase all of the interests of Eagle 's secured lenders , which total $ 11.5 million , and guarantee as much as $ 8.2 million in payments to Eagle 's unsecured creditors . ### A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , Eagle said . ### The plan would extend the period under which Eagle has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan . ### It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder . ### A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Nov. 3 on these accords . ### In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line . ### In September 1988 , Eagle acquired Biny Clothing Inc. , a closely held New York chain operated under the Bonds name . ### Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company . ### At the time , Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $ 8 million , and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $ 2 million . ### But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged . ### Under Chapter 11 , a company operates under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debts . ### Standard & Poor 's Corp. said it would add John H. Harland Co. , an Atlanta check printer , to its 500-stock index , effective at the close of trading on Wednesday . ### American Medical International Inc. , a New York hospital operator , will be deleted from the index at that time . ### American Medical is being acquired . ### The tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act . ### Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans . ### Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $ 1.31 trillion , the lowest since August 1988 . ### As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits . ### As interest rates paid depositors were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 5.1 billion , not including interest credited to accounts . ### It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said . ### The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large California institutions . ### `` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va . ### `` This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon . '' ### James Barth , an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors . ### `` August is a month when people are paying school tuition , '' he said . ### `` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . '' ### Not including thrifts under government conservatorship , S&Ls reduced their assets by $ 10.1 billion from the previous month , and deposit outflows totaled $ 3.9 billion . ### For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion . ### Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month . ### As of Aug. 31 , thrifts held $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities . ### The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year . ### Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink . ### `` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in rates , '' Mr. Ely said . ### For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion . ### For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion . ### The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth . ### Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics . ### If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP . ### It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System , and the informed public generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability . ### In the early 1980s , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade . ### This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes , the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s . ### There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981 . ### But I had expected more , which is one reason I began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates . ### The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated . ### -LRB- It is , however , possible , that further study will reveal increasing bias . -RRB- ### This bias is in no way deliberate . ### The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data . ### The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data . ### This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor . ### In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s . ### Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year , on average . ### The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well . ### Independent estimates of output in those industries , including one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988 . ### Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year . ### The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes . ### I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product . ### Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services . ### In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed . ### Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate . ### In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP . ### For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point . ### In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20 % . ### Mr. Kendrick is professor emeritus of economics at George Washington University . ### He is co-author of `` Personal Productivity : How to Increase Your Satisfaction in Living '' -LRB- M.E. Sharp , 1988 -RRB- . ### Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business . ### Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago . ### Sales were $ 2.14 billion , up 1.6 % from $ 2.11 billion the previous year . ### Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter . ### But the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on Wall Street . ### `` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Carbide closed at $ 24.50 a share , down 50 cents . ### Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories . ### Prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols , products used in making antifreeze . ### Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts . ### The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective . ### A Carbide spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold . '' ### For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense . ### Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million . ### In the industrial-gases segment , operating profit climbed to $ 87 million from $ 58 million . ### The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses . ### Propylene glycols are used in making personal-care products such as shampoo , and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products . ### That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business . ### Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits . ### For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago . ### Sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion . ### At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders . ### The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions . ### Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico . ### Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state . ### These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon . ### But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri . ### Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel . ### They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked . ### Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties . ### These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street . ### Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions . ### Drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt . ### It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking . ### Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved . ### Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states . ### But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public . ### `` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel . ### The question , she said , is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . '' ### While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions . ### I can see both sides . '' ### Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue . ### Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , he said . ### Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . '' ### Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . '' ### Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million . ### By the end of this week , Drexel should have another three to four settlements , Mr. Cohen said . ### `` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said . ### That total would be important for Drexel . ### The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry . ### A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday . ### There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling . ### Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state . ### New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused . ### The state is n't ruling out revoking Drexel 's brokerage license . ### The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser . ### State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed -LRB- Drexel -RRB- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . '' ### Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license . ### It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters . ### `` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said . ### A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . '' ### Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties . ### Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so . ### But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials . ### Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago . ### Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing . ### `` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said . ### `` We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again . '' ### These are the 26 states , including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico , that have settled with Drexel : Alaska , Arkansas , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Utah , Vermont , Washington , Wyoming and Puerto Rico . ### Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 176 million , or $ 2.88 cents a share , reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3 % stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction . ### Separately , Warner reported a net loss of $ 106 million , or 56 cents a share , including merger expenses of $ 100 million and $ 120 million in charges associated with stock-appreciation-based compensation plans . ### Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares . ### Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow , which the company defined as earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization . ### On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner . ### Some analysts at least are buying that argument , and were n't alarmed by the losses . ### `` What really matters is the operating income of the divisions : I look at these numbers and I say , these businesses are doing well , '' said Mark Manson , a vice president of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp . ### `` For example , Warner made more than $ 100 million from filmed entertainment in three months . ### That 's a big number . ### Warner also had a gain of more than 13 % from records and music publishing , even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer . '' ### In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share . ### Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $ 2.2 billion , compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $ 1.1 billion . ### On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier . ### On the same basis , revenue rose to $ 2.7 billion from $ 2.2 billion . ### For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share . ### Revenue rose to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.1 billion . ### The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. , which Warner acquired in January . ### Time Warner 's operating earnings got a boost from Warner 's record box-office results . ### `` Batman '' alone has racked up more than $ 247 million in box-office receipts to date , making it Warner Bros . ' largest grossing film ever . ### `` Lethal Weapon II '' was also a big hit . ### Warner also contributed record results from its music business , where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50 % from a year ago , the company said , helped by Prince 's `` Batman '' soundtrack . ### Time Warner said its cable division turned in a 77 % increase in operating cash flow , to $ 166 million from $ 94 million , reflecting higher per-subscriber revenue . ### In addition , the 1988 results included a $ 20 million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at American Television & Communications Corp . ### On the other hand , Time Warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division , its books division and the Home Box Office programming division . ### In magazines , higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines . ### The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ 12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO 's Comedy Channel . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Time Warner closed at $ 138.625 a share , up $ 1.875 , while Warner closed at $ 63.875 a share , up 12.5 cents . ### Robert J. Penn , president and chief executive officer , will take early retirement from this steelmaker Dec 31 . ### William S. Leavitt , chairman , said Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor . ### UNR recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left 64 % of the reorganized company 's common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos-disease claims trust . ### The company said it would have no further comment . ### Mr. Leavitt , 37 , was elected chairman earlier this year by the company 's new board , having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs . ### His father , David S. Leavitt , was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago , at which time Mr. Penn was named president . ### Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President Bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself . ### Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp . ### The Oversight Board , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August , sets policy for the RTC , which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets . ### Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board . ### President Bush must appoint two other members , one a Democrat and one a Republican . ### An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way . ### The Democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said . ### Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review . ### The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years . ### Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices . ### Valley National , for example , had $ 470 million in problem assets as of June . ### `` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said . ### `` The RTC needs the most able , competent management available . '' ### But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking . ### He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's Arizona campaign committee in last year 's election , and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election . ### The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director . ### In 1986 , Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp . ### That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines . ### Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state . ### The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , Kweisi Mfume -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- and Paul Kanjorski -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- . ### Randolph W. McElroy , a vice chairman of this bank-holding company , was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit , Sovran Bank . ### Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit . ### Sovran also named John B. Werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial , increasing the number of corporate board members to 35 . ### Mr. Werner , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit . ### Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company . ### The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance . ### Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC . ### Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes . ### At Lloyd 's of London , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper . ### Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London . ### Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present . ### Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation . ### The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters , the most recent of which is last week 's earthquake in California 's Bay Area . ### At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business . ### The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors . ### `` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence . ### It needs more discipline . ### It needs to sort itself out . '' ### Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well-heeled investors -LRB- some of them royal -RRB- who , as members of about 360 syndicates , underwrite policies . ### Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignations in 1987 . ### Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year . ### Lackluster returns are one reason . ### The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London . ### In 1985 , it was 2.1 % . ### Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses -LRB- $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange rates -RRB- , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period . ### Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability . ### Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe . ### And catastrophes are getting ever more costly . ### Lloyd 's claims for the 1988 Piper Alpha oil-rig disaster in the North Sea , for instance , may reach $ 1 billion . ### During the five-year period ended 1986 , roughly 80 % of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according to Chatset consultants . ### The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now . ### `` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' Betty Atkins , a secretary from suburban London , says . ### Ms. Atkins , whose Lloyd 's membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981 , belongs to Mr. Nutting 's dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate , which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims . ### Ms. Atkins , who underwrote # 20,000 , or about $ 32,000 , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000 . ### `` If Lloyd 's wants # 70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I 've got -- and even then I do n't know if it will be enough , '' she says . ### Unease is widespread among exchange members . ### `` I ca n't think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now , '' says Keith Whitten , a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979 . ### The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . '' ### If profits do n't improve , Mr. Whitten says he may quit the exchange . ### Meanwhile , competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying . ### Lloyd 's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance . ### Over the past decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in London , where half the world 's ships are insured . ### Lloyd 's 66 % stake in that market has shrunk to 50 % in that period , according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters , a Lloyd 's competitor . ### The official asked not to be named . -RRB- ### Much of the business has gone to the institute , an association of more than 100 insurers , including Cigna Corp. , Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain 's Commercial Union Assurance PLC . ### Lloyd 's has endured decades of genteel decline . ### At the peak of its power and influence a century ago , Lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a 50 % stake . ### It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe . ### Today , Lloyd 's share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is about 2 % . ### Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . -RRB- ### Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say . ### Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business . ### Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage . ### Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged . ### Only 10 years ago , for instance , Lloyd 's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses . ### But since 1981 , Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington , Ky. has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market . ### Ronald Kirk , president , says Lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries . ### Thus , he asserts , Lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition . ### `` Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation , '' he says . ### They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . '' ### Murray Lawrence , Lloyd 's chairman , agrees the exchange faces big challenges . ### `` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says . ### We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . '' ### Lloyd 's , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses . ### By that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance . ### The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets . ### That wo n't be an easy task . ### Tradition is dictator at Lloyd 's . ### Three years ago , the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain 's Prince Charles has denounced . ### Some exchange wags call the building `` the oil rig . '' -RRB- ### But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson 's spyglass , Lloyd 's also brought its outmoded ways of doing business . ### The Lloyd 's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 hours a day , brokers say . ### Underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m . ### A two-hour lunch break follows . ### Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m. , just in time for afternoon tea . ### Lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks . ### The hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages . ### Sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies . ### Brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines , waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters . ### A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates . ### It could take six months for a claim to be paid . ### `` The system , '' says Nicholas Samengo-Turner , a Lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in 1985 , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . '' ### Some maintain underwriters also have been inept . ### John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 . ### `` How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he says . ### Lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter . ### More recently , property rates have increased . ### Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . ### But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . ### The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims . ### Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . ### That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims . ### But Mr. Lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be . ### Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses -LRB- including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo . ### Lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion . ### Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names . ### Meanwhile , the exchange has been trying to lower costs . ### It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB- ### But Lloyd 's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology . ### Mr. Wetherell , the underwriter , reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least 10 % . ### Though Lloyd 's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions , the effort has n't gotten very far . ### Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information . ### Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings , even for routine policies . ### Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies . ### Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers . ### Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada . ### But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented . ### The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand . ### Lloyd 's is moving forward on some fronts , though . ### Mr. Lawrence says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims . ### By next year , all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims . ### Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president . ### Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman . ### Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm . ### In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one . ### The title of chief executive officer is n't used . ### While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many . ### It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president . ### Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing . ### Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms . ### As of March 31 , the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen -LRB- $ 5.64 billion -RRB- . ### For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated -LRB- parent company -RRB- net income of 79.03 billion yen -LRB- $ 556.5 million -RRB- on revenue of 332.38 billion yen -LRB- $ 2.34 billion -RRB- . ### Both figures were record highs . ### Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition . ### All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. , the world 's largest , Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. , Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets . ### While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S . ### American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities . ### And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors . ### At the same time , Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors . ### Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand . ### When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors . ### `` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit . ### But not a single piece of paper was sold . '' ### By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds . ### In an interview a few months ago , he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues . ### But he could n't sell any . ### Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds ? ### Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said . ### Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing . ### Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled . ### Undaunted , Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it . '' ### He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions . ### Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors . ### Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 . ### Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual investors . ### In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations . ### `` He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said Takuro Isoda , chairman of Daiwa 's U.S. unit in New York . ### But it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency . ### Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies ' earnings . ### And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force `` would be fragile , '' said a Daiwa executive . ### If Mr. Dozen has a weakness , it may be his golf game . ### `` He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , '' said Mr. Yoneyama . ### Inco Ltd. posted a 35 % decline in third-quarter net income , a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations . ### The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding . ### Inco shares fell after the announcements . ### Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend . ### Inco closed at $ 31.125 a share , down 62.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . ### Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year . ### The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3 . ### Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier . ### Sales rose 8.2 % to $ 848.7 million from $ 784.5 million . ### Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share . ### Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore . ### Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable . ### Under a previous buyback program , Inco has purchased 1.7 million of its shares since April . ### UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now . ### As a result , UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company . ### The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility . ### The effort to create the nation 's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion offer . ### Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support . ### Takeover stock traders , focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news . ### UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement . ### Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . ### The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal . ### Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid . ### But the board said it was n't interested for now . ### That proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands . ### The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan . ### And , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it . ### The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . '' ### But it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy . ### The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . '' ### Mr. Wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline . ### He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . '' ### But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again . ### Labor problems top the list . ### For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United 's pilot union . ### In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted . ### That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out . ### As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft . ### It 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement . ### The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . '' ### The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions . ### The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction . ### The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union . ### The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out . ### They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost . ### His credibility is also on the line in the investment community . ### Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines . ### But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options . ### The board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer . ### It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits . ### Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value . ### One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote . ### The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees . ### Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline . ### However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential UAL data . ### Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share . ### Tandy Corp. said it wo n't join U.S. Memories , the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips . ### Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories . ### Last month , Apple Computer Inc. said that it would n't invest in the group . ### Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development . ### U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the Japanese . ### Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips . ### Tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor . ### `` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning . ### Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage U.S. Memories ' failure . ### `` I would like to have had them , '' he said . ### But `` they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it . '' ### Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp . ### Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably late this week . ### U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join . ### But so far , most potential participants have n't decided . ### Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week . ### American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories ' business plan . ### Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation . ### A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration . ### In a startling turnabout , Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them . ### David Boren , the Intelligence Committee chairman , is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination . ### With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service . ### If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the American people ought to know . ### What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry . ### Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity . ### But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue . ### And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy , it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too . ### The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega . ### When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads . ### The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity . ### But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress ? ### For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ? ### What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops ? ### Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol . ### Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning : You have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you . ### Or maybe a Surgeon General 's warning : Confiding in the United States may be fatal . ### CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup . ### The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point . ### `` The interpretation '' of the executive order , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . '' ### In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA . ### The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter . ### And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties . ### Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North . ### The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . '' ### No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it . ### What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ? ### Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play ? ### The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action . ### President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security . ### There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars . ### The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed . ### In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility . ### The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral . ### As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi . ### It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal . ### Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him . ### We 've heard California 's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years , but ABC 's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance . ### Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes . ### Both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years , even while the price of gasoline has fallen . ### Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch . ### A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here , injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the Houston Ship Channel . ### There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night . ### The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air . ### One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors . ### Glenn Cox , Phillips ' president and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions . ### In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 . ### The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast . ### The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area . ### The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo . ### Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control . ### The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school . ### The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away . ### Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise . ### The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said . ### The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts . ### The number working at the time of the blast was n't known . ### Yesterday 's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant . ### In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house . ### The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene , polypropylene and K-resin , plastics used in a wide array of applications , including milk jugs and toys . ### Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips ' chemicals operations , which is the biggest single contributor to the company 's profits . ### A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $ 250,000 , representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . ### Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law . ### Joseph Lombardo , who the government alleged was the `` captain '' of organized crime in Chicago , was one of numerous defendants in the government 's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters . ### In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering . ### Among other things , the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union 's top officials . ### U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union . ### Mr. Lombardo , the last of the defendants to settle the suit , agreed to pay the government the $ 250,000 within one week . ### Exxon Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 9 % as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged . ### All cleanup costs from last spring 's Alaskan oil spill were reflected in earlier results , it said . ### Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. also reported declines in quarterly profit , while Ashland Oil Inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter . ### Amerada Hess Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported higher earnings . ### Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill , those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $ 880 million in charges taken during the first half . ### An Exxon official said that at this time the oil company does n't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil spilled when one of its tankers rammed into an underwater reef . ### She added , however , that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill . ### She said that impact ca n't be reasonably assessed yet . ### Exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ 1.11 billion , or 87 cents a share , from $ 1.22 billion , or 93 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue rose 8.1 % , to $ 23.65 billion from $ 21.88 billion . ### During the third quarter , Exxon purchased 8.34 million shares of its stock at a cost of $ 373 million . ### Exxon 's profitability , like that of many other oil companies , was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses . ### Exxon 's earnings from chemicals operations fell $ 90 million , to $ 254 million , while refining and marketing profits declined $ 180 million , to $ 357 million . ### Although crude oil prices were significantly higher this year , they were n't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business sectors at most oil companies , said William Randol , oil analyst for First Boston Corp . ### He estimates that the price of West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , was $ 4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year . ### A rash of one-time charges left Ashland Oil with a loss of $ 39 million for its fiscal fourth quarter . ### A year earlier , the refiner earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share . ### Quarterly revenue rose 4.5 % , to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.2 billion . ### For the year , net income tumbled 61 % to $ 86 million , or $ 1.55 a share . ### The Ashland , Ky. , oil company reported a $ 38 million charge resulting from settlement of a 10-year dispute with the National Iranian Oil Co. over claims that Ashland did n't pay for Iranian crude it had received . ### In September , Ashland settled the long-simmering dispute by agreeing to pay Iran $ 325 million . ### Ashland also took a $ 25 million after-tax charge to cover anticipated costs to correct problems with boilers built by one of its subsidiaries . ### The oil refiner also booked a $ 15 million charge for selling Ashland Technology Corp. , one of its subsidiaries , at a loss . ### Third-quarter earnings at Amerada Hess more than tripled to $ 51.81 million , or 64 cents a share , from $ 15.7 million , or 20 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue climbed 28 % , to $ 1.18 billion from $ 925 million . ### Profits improved across Hess 's businesses . ### Refining and marketing earnings climbed to $ 33.3 million from $ 12.9 million , and exploration and production earnings rose to $ 37.1 million from $ 17.9 million . ### Hess 's earnings were up despite a $ 30 million charge to cover the cost of maintaining operations after Hurricane Hugo heavily damaged the company 's refinery at St. Croix . ### It is widely known within industry circles that Hess had to buy oil products in the high-priced spot markets to continue supplying its customers . ### Hess declined to comment . ### Phillips Petroleum 's third-quarter earnings slid 60 % , to $ 87 million , or 36 cents a share , from $ 215 million , or 89 cents a share . ### Revenue rose 6.9 % , to $ 3.1 billion from $ 2.9 billion . ### Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline , said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement . ### Despite higher oil prices , exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of Phillips ' North Sea oil fields . ### A year ago , results were buoyed by a $ 20 million after-tax gain from an asset sale . ### Occidental Petroleum 's third-quarter net income rose 2.9 % to $ 108 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ 105 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier . ### The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $ 71 million from non-recurring items . ### Sales dropped 2 % , to $ 4.8 billion from $ 4.9 billion . ### The latest period included a $ 54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties , a $ 22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental 's domestic oil and gas operations , and tax credits of $ 42 million . ### Both periods included non-recurring charges of $ 3 million for early retirement of debt . ### Occidental said oil and gas earnings fell to $ 17 million from $ 20 million . ### The latest period includes net gains of $ 32 million in non-recurring credits from the sale of properties , indicating operating losses for the quarter in the oil and gas division . ### Chemical earnings fell 10 % , reflecting softening of demand . ### Citing its reduced ownership in the Lyondell Petrochemical Co. , Atlantic Richfield reported that net income slid 3.1 % in the third quarter to $ 379 million , or $ 2.19 a share , from $ 391 million , or $ 2.17 a share , for the comparable period last year . ### Sales fell 20 % , to $ 3.7 billion from $ 4.6 billion . ### Arco 's earnings from its 49.9 % stake in Lyondell fell to $ 37 million from $ 156 million for the same period last year , when Lyondell was wholly owned . ### Offsetting the lower stake in Lyondell were higher crude oil prices , increased natural gas volumes and higher coke prices , the company said . ### Coal earnings rose to $ 26 million from $ 21 million . ### For the nine months , Arco reported net income of $ 1.6 billion , or $ 8.87 a share , up 33 % from $ 1.2 billion or $ 6.56 a share a year earlier . ### Sales were $ 12 billion , off 13 % from $ 13.8 billion . ### Jeff Rowe contributed to this article . ### The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : ### Imo Industries Inc. -- $ 150 million of senior subordinated debentures due 2001 , priced at par to yield 12 % . ### The issue will be sold through Morgan Stanley & Co . ### Other details were n't available . ### San Antonio , Texas -- $ 575 million of electric and gas system revenue refunding bonds , Series 1989 , 1989A and 1989B , tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group to yield from 6.15 % in 1991 to 7.30 % in 2009 . ### The issue includes current interest bonds due 1991-2000 , 2009 , 2012 , 2014 and 2016 , and capital appreciation bonds due 2001-2005 . ### The current interest serial bonds are priced to yield from 6.15 % in 1991 to 7.10 % in 2000 . ### There are about $ 100 million of 7 % term bonds due 2009 , priced to yield 7.30 % , which is the issue 's high yield . ### There are also about $ 124 million of 6 % bonds priced to yield 7.25 % in 2012 ;

's National Broadcasting Co . ### The premiere of `` Showdown , '' with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter , a columnist with the New York Daily News , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m . ### CNBC is available to 13 million cable households . ### Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . ### But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . ### I 'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home . ### But that does n't mean I 'm not going to get angry . '' ### Michael Eskridge , president of CNBC , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` Mort Mort Mort '' But just how does Mr. Downey 's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of CNBC 's business programming ? ### `` Ninety percent of Mort 's old show fits into our style , '' said Mr. Eskridge . ### That is consumer issues . '' ### Mr. Downey 's previous show , a one-hour shout fest , syndciated by MCA Inc. and produced by Quantum Media Inc. , was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it . ### Investors dumped stocks of big companies whose earnings fluctuate with the economy . ### Many of those `` cyclical '' issues are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which fell 26.23 to 2662.91 . ### Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced advancers , 1,012 to 501 . ### Recession fears are springing up again among investors . ### Analysts say that the selling of cyclical stocks yesterday will be followed by a sell-off in shares of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets . ### In an economic slowdown , heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of companies because cash that would normally be used to keep the company buoyant must be diverted to interest payments . ### On the other hand , investors beat a clear path yesterday to blue-chip issues with proven earnings growth records . ### Among the 30 Dow industrials , they bought McDonald 's , Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble and sold Aluminum Co. of America . ### In another sign of slowdown fears , investors dumped technology shares . ### Many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets . ### `` The junk bond market is being taken apart '' because of recession fears , said J. David Mills , senior vice president at Boston Company Advisers . ### Under this scrutiny , the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies . '' ### In fact , much of the buying in blue chips yesterday was a pursuit of companies with lower debt levels . ### In a recent investment letter entitled `` Winners of the ` Leverage Wars , ' `` Edward Kerschner , chairman of PaineWebber 's investment policy committee , suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt . ### `` We 're saying companies have to pay increasing attention to balance sheets , '' said Mr. Kerschner . ### He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea , J. Baker , McDonald 's , Philip Morris and Sara Lee . ### He said that all of these companies will be able to compete fiercely in an economic downturn . ### McDonald 's has long-term debt equaling 91 % of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $ 2.6 billion below their real value . ### Coca-Cola climbed 1 to 72 1 to 31 , and Procter & Gamble gained to 130 . ### A&P fell 1 to 57 , and J. Baker gained to 21 . ### Philip Morris slipped to 43 , while Sara Lee closed unchanged at 60 . ### According to Salomon Brothers ' `` stub '' stock index of 20 companies whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity , investors are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden companies . ### From January to early September , the index of stub stocks -- the tiny portion of equity that 's publicly traded following a recapitalization -- outperformed Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index by about 20 % . ### But starting in early September , the index started to slide and now stands about even with the S&P 500 . ### `` Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk , '' said Eric Sorenson , director of quantitative analysis at Salomon Brothers . ### `` Companies that have the most exposure to the business cycle have underperformed since late last summer . '' ### Union Carbide , whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35 % from a year earlier and fell short of analysts ' expectations , declined to 24 . ### Also , Exxon went down to 45 and Allied-Signal lost to 35 even though the companies ' results for the quarter were in line with forecasts . ### Other weak blue-chip issues included Chevron , which went down 2 to 64 in Big Board composite trading of 1.3 million shares ; Goodyear Tire & Rubber , off 1 to 46 , and American Express , down to 37 . ### Texas Instruments , which had reported Friday that third-quarter earnings fell more than 30 % from the year-ago level , went down 2 to 33 on 1.1 million shares . ### Motorola , another major semiconductor producer , dropped 1 to 57 . ### Pinnacle West Capital , whose earnings have been hurt by continued problems at its MeraBank unit , fell 1 to 9 on 2.1 million shares to lead the Big Board 's list of most active issues . ### Growing pressures on the Arizona real-estate market are affecting the thrift ; Pinnacle West told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it may consider filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if it ca n't reach an agreement with federal regulators to provide additional capital to MeraBank . ### Hercules dropped 2 to 41 on one million shares -- about six times its average daily trading volume -- after a disappointing third-quarter earnings report . ### Merrill Lynch and Prudential-Bache Securities both lowered the stock 's investment rating immediately after the results were issued Friday , according to PIR . ### Elsewhere in the chemicals sector , Dow Chemical fell 1 to 97 1 , to 1 to . ### Other stocks hurt by earnings-related selling included Tandy , which dropped 1 to 44 , and Eaton , which retreated 2 to 57 . ### Third-quarter earnings at both companies were below analysts ' forecasts . ### After declining about 41 % last week , UAL advanced 9 to 178 on 1.1 million shares on anticipation of a revised takeover offer from a labor-management group for the parent company of United Airlines . ### However , Delta Air Lines fell 1 to 67 and USAir Group dropped to 42 . ### Ramada gained to 11 after revamping the terms of its restructuring plan , which calls for the company to sell its hotel operations for $ 540 million and spin off its casino business to shareholders . ### The revision follows last month 's withdrawal of a $ 400 million junk-bond offering for the new casino company , Aztar Corp . ### Mead gained 1 to 37 . ### USA Today reported that the Rales brothers , Washington , D.C.-based investors who made an unsuccessful offer to acquire Interco last year , have bought nearly 3 % of Mead 's common shares . ### Entertainment and media stocks generally escaped the market 's slide as well . ### Paramount Communications rose to 58 , Time Warner climbed 1 to 138 , Walt Disney advanced 3 to 127 1 to 65 and McGraw-Hill added to 67 . ### The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 3.11 to 379.46 . ### Volume totaled 10,450,000 shares . ### Carnival Cruise Lines Class A fell 1 to 20 . ### The company said it had been notified unofficially that Waertsilae Marine Industries , a Finnish shipyard building three cruise ships for the company , is having financial trouble and may already have filed for bankruptcy . ### `` Hacksaw '' and `` Bonecrusher '' are the sort of nicknames normally associated with linebackers and heavyweight contenders . ### Who 'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents ? ### Chicago 's new school chief is the hard-nosed Ted Kimbrough . ### At his old job in Compton , Calif. , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member . ### At his first Chicago press conference , he berated the reporters . ### In New York City , the new Chancellor , Joseph Fernandez , has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform . ### Both men fit the mood of the times -- the mood being one of a public fed up with officials ' rationalizations for why their schools do n't work . ### Former Patterson , N.J. , principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator . ### The subject of the movie `` Lean on Me , '' Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat . ### He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold ? ### Elena Scambio , the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state , says her top priority will be to `` cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy . '' ### Mr. Fernandez does n't take control in New York until January , but already he 's roiling the waters . ### He 's attacked the concept of `` building tenure , '' one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools . ### It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals . ### Once they are in the building , they stay . ### One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work . ### He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack . ### Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge . ### We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal , toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they 're defending . ### In his old job , as Dade County chief , Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals . ### He cut the dropout rate by 5.5 % . ### But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well ; incompetent principals and administrators should go , but the good ones ought to be left alone . ### The situation will be especially delicate for Mr. Kimbrough . ### He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform . ### Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards , one for each school . ### This of course led to disaster in New York City . ### Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential , but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them . ### The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems . ### The schools ' central mission , educating children , became subsumed by the competing interests of bureaucrats , politicians and unions . ### The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped learning . ### Mr. Chips was a nice fellow , and maybe some day he 'll return . ### Until then , it 's clear that some of the people who 've been keeping big-city schools down are going to be dealing with the Terminator . ### Ingersoll Publications Co. agreed to buy the New Haven Register in a transaction valued at $ 275 million from Goodson Newspaper Group Inc . ### As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently . ### Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun . ### Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . ### Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract . ### Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . ### Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr . ### Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 . ### The New Jersey paper , like the New Haven , Conn. , paper , was purchased by Ingersoll on Goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract . ### Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances . ### Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers . ### David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers . ### Goodson said David Carr , former president of Ingersoll Publications , and Ray Cockburn , former senior vice president , would head the new in-house management team at Goodson , which had revenue of $ 225 million in 1988 . ### The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll . ### The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson . ### But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co . ### Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe . ### The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year . ### Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is `` delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship '' and will be able to `` concentrate all our energies '' on Ingersoll 's own papers . ### Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers . ### Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , Kenneth Roman , Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co . ### Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications . ### He will succeed Harry L. Freeman , 57 , who has said he will retire in December . ### Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra . ### American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra . ### The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him . ### Although Mr. Freeman is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis . ### Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy . ### The agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before succumbing in May . ### And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company . ### Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency . ### Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British . ### Alexander Brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations . ### He had been president of the international operations . ### Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP . ### Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job . ### Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative American Express mold . ### Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident . ### He also is close to American Express 's chairman and chief executive officer , James D. Robinson III . ### Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson . ### The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy 's top spot by Mr. Sorrell . ### But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine -LRB- The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client -RRB- . ### He asked me not to resign . ### The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman said . ### Mr. Sorrell , traveling in the Far East , could n't be reached . ### Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September . ### According to industry executives , Peter Sutherland , a former European Community commissioner from Ireland , was also a serious contender for the American Express job . ### Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters . ### After talking on and off for the past four weeks , Mr. Roman said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the company in very strong hands . ### It was my decision , not anyone else 's . '' ### Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips , his successor at Ogilvy . ### The two executives could hardly be more different . ### Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive ; Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality . ### During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes . ### Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the WPP takeover brought them closer together . ### I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. Sorrell -RCB- as my successor . ### Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ? '' Mr. Roman asked . ### He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut . ### Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units . ### `` I consider this a second career , '' he said . ### He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives . ### Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy . ### American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency . ### `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods . ### But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients . ### `` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers . ### I do n't know -LCB- Mr. Phillips -RCB- all that well . ### I have n't seen or talked to him in several years . '' ### And some analysts questioned whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills Ogilvy needs to turn the agency around . ### While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House . ### I think -LCB- Mr. Phillips -RCB- is going to need some help . ### I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co . ### Ogilvy & Mather 's top creative executive , Norman Berry , left the agency earlier this year . ### `` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill . ### But other analysts said that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition . ### `` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert . ### It 's probably a reasonable transition . ### Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York . '' ### Sale of Saatchi Unit Close ### Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi ### Computer Sciences would n't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting , which counsels companies on logistics and supply . ### But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue . ### Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale . ### Ad Notes . ### NEW ACCOUNT : AmBase Corp. , New York , awarded the ad account for its Home Insurance Co. unit to Biederman , Kelly & Shaffer , New York . ### Billings were n't disclosed . ### Puerto Rico Telephone Co. awarded its $ 3 million account to West Indies & Grey , Grey Advertising 's office in Puerto Rico . ### DIET COKE : Coca-Cola Co. yesterday said singer Elton John signed to appear in an ad for Diet Coke . ### Details of the commercial , which will be part of the brand 's 1990 advertising campaign , were n't disclosed . ### Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars , including George Michael and Whitney Houston , to appear in ads for the diet drink . ### Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . ### The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . ### The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' produced by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . ### Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . ### In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally . ### But he said Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S . ### `` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the U.S. , '' he said , adding that Turner Pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991 . ### Turner has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters . ### Mr. Hogan said `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming '' and `` Treasure Island '' cost more than $ 6 million each to make , which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release . ### The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films . ### In July , Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters . ### In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte . ### Paribas said that once it receives the go-ahead from French stock market authorities , it will offer to boost its Navigation Mixte stake to 66.7 % from the current 18.7 % . ### Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs -LRB- $ 3.62 billion -RRB- , making this one of France 's largest-ever attempted takeovers . ### The cost of buying the additional 48 % stake would be 10.95 billion francs -LRB- $ 1.74 billion -RRB- . ### The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong . ### It also would make Paribas a major French ally of West Germany 's Allianz AG insurance group . ### Allianz holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago . ### Those include Rhin et Moselle Vie and Via Assurances . ### Long considered a potential takeover target , Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders . ### That idea may have backfired . ### Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral . ### Navigation Mixte said it would n't have any comment until its board meets Wednesday . ### But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend . ### `` The defensive options are limited , '' says Philippe Braye , a partner in portfolio management concern France Finance Quatre . ### Who would bid against Paribas ? '' ### If the Paribas bid succeeds , it will be the second time in two months a big French investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group . ### Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG . ### That complex bid was billed as France 's largest takeover ever -LRB- this one is slightly smaller -RRB- . ### Moreover , Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique . ### Paribas officials , once considered France 's toughest bankers , felt abashed at Suez 's success and its rapid growth . ### Although Paribas denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France 's two largest investment banking groups . ### It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in Europe to keep up as the European Community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992 . ### Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet would n't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte 's insurance operations to Allianz , he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate . ### He also told reporters the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak . ### Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others . ### And Navigation Mixte has a huge hidden attraction . ### Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs . ### Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created July 1 , which are eligible for partial dividends . ### Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte share . ### Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid . ### Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it . ### This is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes . ### Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price . ### Mr. Francois-Poncet responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake , striking an alliance with current management . ### When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control . ### He told reporters he had information that Mr. Fournier was preparing to buy as much as 20 % of Paribas , up from less than 5 % currently . ### A bid against Paribas could n't be ruled out . ### France 's second-largest government-owned insurance company , Assurances Generales de France , has been building its own Navigation Mixte stake , currently thought to be between 8 % and 10 % . ### Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached . ### Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said OPEC oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter . ### In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 for December delivery . ### Petroleum products prices also declined . ### Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day . ### That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong . ### But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further . ### The group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early 1990 . ### With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices . ### Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude , analysts say , now the facility wo n't need any , at a time of already high availability . ### The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . ### A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out . ### Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said . ### There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company . ### Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices . ### For instance , one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ 20 a barrel . ### `` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he said . ### In other commodity markets yesterday : COPPER : The selling that started on Friday continued yesterday ### The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 . ### London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . ### The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . ### Fund selling also picked up at that point . ### According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts . ### This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling . ### Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market . ### Such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong British pound to buy copper in New York . ### `` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said . ### Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ 1.19 to $ 1.34 . ### Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ 1.04 . ### PRECIOUS METALS : Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments , which use both metals , showed signs of producing extra heat . ### January platinum closed down $ 2.80 an ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day . ### December palladium was off $ 1.55 an ounce at $ 137.20 . ### Platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 . ### Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report , which will be released today . ### Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters . ### Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories . ### He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again . ### Also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier , the Soviet Union . ### Many analysts believe that the Soviets ' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much . ### GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news . ### On the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans for November delivery closed at $ 5.63 a bushel , down half a cent , while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 a bushel . ### Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union . ### But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt . ### Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices . ### SUGAR : World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts . ### The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound , down 0.37 cent . ### For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . ### But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . ### Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents . ### But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . '' ### A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country . ### COCOA : Futures rallied modestly . ### The December contract rose $ 33 a metric ton to $ 1,027 , near its high for the day . ### Gill & Duffus Ltd. , a British cocoa-trading house , estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons , down from 314,000 tons for the previous year . ### Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies . ### Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s . ### At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon . ### But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level . ### He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move . ### Sandra Kaul , research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton , said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast , a major cocoa producer . ### Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss , a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo . ### The price was 3.6 billion yen -LRB- $ 25 million -RRB- . ### The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai-Goss , which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry . ### The purchase was made by Rockwell Graphic Systems , a Chicago subsidiary of the El Segundo , Calif. , concern . ### Ikegai-Goss , which has about 200 employees , is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology , which reduces time and materials waste when preparing a press for printing . ### The bond market , which sometimes thrives on bad news , cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker . ### Early in the day , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble . ### Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession . ### For example , today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report . ### The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2 % drop in September orders . ### That would follow a 3.9 % advance in August . ### Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower . ### The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 . ### `` Bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' said Joel Marver , chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group . ### `` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said . ### The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about point higher , or up about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % Friday . ### Municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose . ### Prices of high-yield , high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged . ### In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers . ### In the Treasury market , analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news . ### `` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . ### On the other hand , we have economic news that is -LCB- expected to be -RCB- relatively positive for the bond market . ### We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . ### Today , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . ### Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . ### So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . ### Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . ### While some say the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . ### The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . ### The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp . ### The issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company . ### First Boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering . ### The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys . ### The only asset-backed deal larger than Ford 's was a $ 4 billion offering by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986 . ### Treasury bonds were to point higher yesterday in light trading . ### The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 , compared with 101 Friday . ### The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 to yield 7.97 % . ### The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.84 % . ### Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale . ### The Treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52 % , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on Oct. 10 . ### The $ 7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the Oct. 10 auction . ### The rates were up from last week 's auction , when they were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively . ### Here are auction details : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value ### Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . ### The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . ### Both issues are dated Oct. 26 . ### The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 26 , 1990 . ### Investment-grade corporates closed about point higher in quiet trading . ### In the junk bond market , Imo Industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield 12 % . ### Peter Karches , managing director at underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co. , said the issue was oversubscribed . ### `` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said . ### Morgan Stanley is expected to price another junk bond deal , $ 350 million of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc. , next Tuesday . ### In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors . ### In the case of Beatrice , Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $ 200 million portion of the offering . ### Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys . ### Under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate to maintain a market value of 101 . ### Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 % and 13 % . ### Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session . ### The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities . ### Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts . ### Traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks . ### In the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the Treasury market . ### Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 , up ; and Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 , up . ### The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 8.36 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points . ### A $ 575 million San Antonio , Texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector . ### The refunding issue , which had been in the wings for two months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation . ### But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off to up point . ### An official with lead underwriter First Boston said orders for the San Antonio bonds were `` on the slow side . '' ### He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace . ### In addition , he noted , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand for bonds . ### A $ 137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start . ### The issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley . ### Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point . ### Japanese government bonds ended lower after the dollar rose modestly against the yen . ### The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan 's bond market . ### The benchmark No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 95.39 , off 0.28 . ### The yield rose to 5.38 % . ### West German bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading . ### The benchmark 7 % bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6 % notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % . ### British government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading as investors looked ahead to today 's British trade report . ### The benchmark 11 % Treasury bond due rose to 111 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12 % issue of 1995 rose to 103 to yield 11.01 % . ### The croaker 's done gone from the hook -- damn My language sure goes to pot down here on the coast . '' ### The husky blond guide with the Aggie cap twists his face in mock fury . ### I got to get back to school and straighten out my English . '' ### He has two more years at Texas A&M . ### Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas , enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond . ### There have been three days of hot , wind-swept rain , and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout , which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts . ### The little radio fizzes as other boats want to see if we have found any fish -- spotting location is everything in this sport . ### Negative answers crackle back . ### The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships . ### We go from one to the other . ### The sun is hot now though it 's only 8 in the morning . ### The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water . ### We cruise toward another set of pilings . ### The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook . ### Then he casts out . ### Just wait for that tap-tap , that thump-thump . ### It comes real gentle before it pulls . ### Do n't forget , trout have very soft mouths .

'' ### There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby . ### People are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves . ### Texas is big and beautiful and they live here , that 's all . ### Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula -LRB- after the oak , not the game -RRB- which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge . ### It is famous as the winter home of the whooping crane , that symbol of the destruction of wild America . ### Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake thinking that it was a snow goose . ### He paid an immense fine and was lucky , according to a local wag , to escape the gas chamber . ### The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see . ### Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies . ### Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills . ### Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky-brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat . ### Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called Tivoli , with a white church , a gas station and a grocery , the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts . ### `` Tivoli Motel , '' I read a sign in the usual pronunciation of the name as we whoosh through . ### `` Here in south Texas we say Tie-vole-ee , '' my host gently corrects . ### Mr. King is the director of the Foreign Press Center in New York . ### AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January . ### The two West German electronics concerns said they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. to merge their activities in the field . ### AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture . ### The joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks -LRB- $ 26.9 million -RRB- and 700 employees . ### It will develop , produce and market high-performance electronic parts . ### Siemens is West Germany 's largest electronics group . ### AEG is 80 % owned by Daimler-Benz AG , the country 's biggest industrial concern . ### Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27 % to $ 29.6 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 40.7 million , or $ 1 a share , a year earlier . ### Sales dropped 4 % to $ 1.12 billion from $ 1.17 billion . ### The company , which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers , said about half the earnings drop came from the `` virtual collapse '' of the Venezuelan auto industry . ### The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year , making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts . ### Dana also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier . ### The company , based in Toledo , Ohio , had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit . ### Mary Anne Sudol , an analyst at Fitch Investors in New York , said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost `` across the board . '' ### Southwood J. Morcott , Dana 's president , said the company 's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength . ### Norimasa Furuta , president of Japan 's Mazda Motor Corp. , said the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with Ford Motor Co. in Europe ahead of the European Community 's 1992 integration . ### Mr. Furuta did n't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference , but said the project would be undertaken with Ford 's European subsidiary . ### A Ford official confirmed in Tokyo that the U.S. motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement . ### At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal . ### At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade . ### It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas . ### Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters . ### And , for Ms. Baker , the ride was far from over . ### Her bare breasts , her dancing , her voice , her beauty and , perhaps most famously , her derriere , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible . ### Bricktop , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's . '' ### Men were a constant complication . ### Baker had lots of them . ### But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust . ### As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy . ### Her appetite for children also was large . ### She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina . ### She made money , but spent more . ### Friends pitched in . ### Finally , Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco . ### Another lifelong complication , as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' -LRB- Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- , was racism . ### Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic . ### African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks . ### To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world . ### Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white audiences -RRB- . ### Paris loved her at first sight . ### `` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately . ### `` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. Rose writes . ### Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous . ### `` Jazz Cleopatra '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works . ### It is easy to see why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage . ### Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject . ### Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term . ### To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with Cleopatra , requires an equal stretch . ### Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life . ### In fact , Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca that could have made it into `` Casablanca . '' ### During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens . ### She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France . ### In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' to drown out the Nazis . ### The night the Germans occupied all of France , Baker performed in Casablanca . ### The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai J'ai deux amours '' they wept . ### Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II . ### In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested . ### It does n't help that sometimes Ms. Rose 's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want . ### One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments . '' ### Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer , Ms. Rose writes : `` She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman . '' ### One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond . ### In `` Josephine Baker '' -LRB- Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 -RRB- , which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month , Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star . ### The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw . ### Or ever will . '' ### Mr. Lescaze is foreign editor of the Journal . ### Manville , having rid itself of asbestos , now sells fiberglass , forest products , minerals and industrial goods . ### Heady stuff it 's not . ### But Manville 's ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors . ### The Denver-based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust . ### The trust , which owns 80 % of Manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims . ### When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash . ### But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . ### Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market . ### `` Their principal asset is Manville common stock , '' says Jeffrey Halis , who runs Sabre Associates , an investment fund that owns Manville shares . ### If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail . ### What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares . '' ### The trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its Manville stock . ### However , the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims . ### Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 . ### The trust also will receive $ 75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from Manville . ### And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income . ### Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch . ### As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each . ### The average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled first -RRB- . ### And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities . ### `` At some point , we 're going to need an infusion of funds , '' a person close to the trust says . ### Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock . ### It does n't pay a dividend , and this trust needs income . ### Moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in Manville , the trust is badly in need of diversification . ### `` Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , '' the person close to the trust says . ### Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring . ### Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . ### We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . ### Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . ### But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 . ### And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name . ### Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders . ### `` This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders , '' one investor says . ### Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term . ### Its stock , at 9 , trades at about 8 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers . ### Mr. Bullock says 45 % of revenues are tied to construction . ### Analysts predict little or no near-term growth . ### They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's management . ### `` It 's one of the best in the business , '' says Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi . ### And he says Manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible other construction-related firms are hurting and selling cheap . ### With a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1-to-1 -- and $ 329 million in cash -- Manville is indeed actively on the prowl . ### So far , as a price-conscious shopper , Manville has n't bought much . ### Paul Kleinaitis , an analyst at Duff & Phelps , says , `` Even though they have borrowing power , they have been disciplined about acquisitions . '' ### And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80 % of its stock in friendly hands , Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul . ### Manville -LRB- NYSE ; Symbol : MVL -RRB- ### Business : Forest products and roofing ### Year ended Dec. 31 , 1988 : Sales : $ 2.06 billions Net loss : $ 1.30 billion ### Third quarter , Sept. 30 , 1989 : Per-share earnings : 30 cents vs. 44 cents ### Average daily trading volume : 74,351 shares ### Common shares outstanding : 120 million ### Includes $ 1.29 billion extraordinary charge . ### Year ago figure is restated . ### Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch G.m.b . H. said the Federal Trade Commission has requested additional information from the two companies about their announced intention to acquire Vermont American Corp. for $ 40 a share , or about $ 440 million . ### Yesterday , in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , Vermont American common closed at $ 39.75 , off 25 cents . ### The FTC 's request was `` not unusual '' and Emerson will make a `` full and prompt '' response , according to a spokesman . ### Spokesmen for Emerson and Vermont American , which has agreed to be acquired , said they do n't anticipate `` any problems '' with the completion of the transaction . ### An FTC spokesman said the matter is `` in a non-public posture at this time '' and declined to comment further . ### Emerson and Bosch , through their joint acquisition arm , Maple Acquisition , have begun a cash tender offer for all of Vermont 's common shares outstanding . ### The offer , set to expire Nov. 1 , may be extended pending the timing and resolution of the FTC request , the companies said . ### St. Louis-based Emerson and Stuttgart-based Bosch make electrical and electronic products , including power tools . ### The Vermont American acquisition is designed to enhance their position in the accessories portion of the power-tool industry . ### Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is preparing a plan to sell a 20 % stake in its large real estate unit to a California public employee pension fund for $ 400 million , after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders . ### The plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation , Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp. , of $ 2 billion . ### Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today , according to people familiar with the transaction . ### If approved , the sale is expected to close by year 's end , with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992 . ### In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific closed at $ 20.625 , down 25 cents . ### Santa Fe Pacific Realty is a major California land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the San Francisco Bay area , and several office sites . ### A spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's Northern California earthquake . ### As a result of the partial sale and spinoff , the $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation , according to officials of the fund , who described the plan . ### A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund . ### Also holding two seats each on the board , they said , would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd. , controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada , and Itel Corp. , controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell . ### The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs . ### Itel bought a 17 % stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20 % stake ; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific . ### The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate . ### The debt-laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price . ### At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze . ### The California pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual . ### Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20 % stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company . ### In addition , pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns . ### But fund officials said the Santa Fe Pacific Realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with California properties . ### It also marks a `` major commitment to -LCB- real estate -RCB- development , which we have n't been involved with before , '' said Dale Hanson , the fund 's executive director . ### Under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $ 75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price . ### The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5 % a year , which would be payable to the fund after five years , according to Stephen E. Roulac , a real estate consultant working for the fund . ### The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said . ### The spun-off concern `` clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio , '' he said . ### For the last year , Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio . ### Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ 71.9 million from $ 143 million a year earlier , the company said . ### In a statement late yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific 's chairman , Robert D. Krebs , said that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $ 500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff . ### That would help reduce Santa Fe Pacific 's remaining debt to about $ 600 million from a high of $ 3.7 billion in early 1988 . ### It was n't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ 500 million , which would be well above the $ 400 million that California pension fund officials say they plan to provide ### The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors , among other possibilities . ### The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation . ### Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property , including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space . ### It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area . ### Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay area , including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area . ### The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments . ### The fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund , and it has a growing cash flow now topping $ 3 billion a year . ### Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific , but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago . ### JMB officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the Santa Fe Pacific Realty board , Mr. Roulac said , to insulate the fund from potential liability problems . ### GAF , Part III is scheduled to begin today . ### After two mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman , James T. Sherwin , have changed considerably . ### The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations . ### In an eight-count indictment , the government charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , chemical maker , and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986 . ### The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin , takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian . ### The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government 's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian . ### Mr. Jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing . ### But GAF 's bellwether role was short-lived . ### The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document . ### After 93 hours of deliberation , the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked , and another mistrial was declared on March 22 . ### Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June . ### A month later , Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government . ### In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts . ### Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the GAF case . ### The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo . ### For Mr. Sherwin , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count . ### GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count . ### Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September , defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial , but by the end of the month the talks had ended . ### There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman . ### Neither testified at the previous trials . ### For now , defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans . ### Max Gitter , another GAF defense attorney , said yesterday , `` As we go in for the third time , Yogi Berra 's famous line is apt : ` It 's deja vu all over again . ' '' ### DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal . ### Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co. , which manufactured the device . ### The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other . ### Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $ 2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan . ### The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims . ### It also bars future suits against Robins company officials , members of the Robins family and Robins 's former insurer , Aetna Life & Casualty Co . ### The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented , '' said Alan B. Morrison , a public interest lawyer in Washington , D.C. , who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants . ### More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending . ### The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries . ### Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts . ### American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted . ### In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week , Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants . ### The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 . ### JURY ` S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first . ### Charles A. Donohoo , sole proprieter of a Louisville , Ky. , demolition company , was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act . ### Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case . ### Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time . ### Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities . ### But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment . ### In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony . ### Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing . ### He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building , a violation of the Clean Air Act . ### The government sought a criminal penalty because `` no cleanup is possible here . ### Once -LCB- asbestos -RCB- is released into the environment , it can lodge anywhere , '' says Richard A. Dennis , the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case . ### Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11 . ### His lawyer could not be reached for comment . ### Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act . ### TED BUNDY'S LAWYERS switch to victims ' side in death-sentence case . ### Wilmer , Cutler & Pickering , the Washington , D.C. , law firm that spent over $ 1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court , this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas . ### The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation , a conservative legal group . ### The key issue in the case , which the law firm is handling without a fee , or pro bono , is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review . ### The murderer , Ronald Gene Simmons , was convicted of killing 14 people . ### Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons 's death sentence in a `` next friend '' capacity . ### Wilmer Cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing . ### P.J. Mode , Wilmer Cutler 's managing partner , says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised . ### The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also , because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work . ### `` We give them a lot of credit for taking this case , '' says WLF 's Alan Slobodin . ### THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS : In federal court in Manhattan , three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs . ### James Burke and Larry Evans , formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery , and Prudence Clark , a Barclay sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs . ### The posters were sold for $ 1,300 to $ 6,000 , although the government says they had a value of only $ 53 to $ 200 apiece . ### Henry Pitman , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million . ### Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales , they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali , who died in January . ### The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. Dali , the attorneys said . ### Westamerica Bancorp. said Richard W. Decker resigned as president and chief executive officer after only a year on the job because of `` differences '' with the board . ### The banking company could n't be reached to comment beyond a written announcement . ### It did n't specify the nature of the differences , saying only that they related to `` management style '' and `` strategic objectives . '' ### Westamerica said Mr. Decker 's posts were assumed by David Payne , Westamerica 's chairman , who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country . ### Mr. Decker is about 45 years old . ### Neither Mr. Payne nor Mr. Decker could be reached to comment . ### Westamerica has about $ 1.3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern California . ### It controls about 35 % of the affluent Marin County market across the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco . ### Mr. Decker 's resignation surprised many industry officials . ### He was brought to the company in September 1988 after 15 years at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp . ### The bank had been suffering in late 1987 from a slew of bad real estate loans made in Arizona . ### When he was hired , Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker 's `` extraordinary... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as one of the West 's brightest bankers . '' ### Though the bank is n't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative California market , its condition has improved since Mr. Decker took over . ### For the six months ended June 30 , it earned $ 3.1 million , or 61 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 2.4 million , or 41 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Its stock also has risen lately , at least partly because it is considered a possible takeover candidate . ### Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in California in 1991 , and larger California banks , such as Wells Fargo & Co. , have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray . ### In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Westamerica closed at $ 22.25 a share , down 75 cents . ### Varian Associates Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif. , reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95 % to $ 1 million , or five cents a share , from $ 24.2 million , or $ 1.10 a share , in the year-earlier quarter . ### The diversified electronics company blamed the decline in the quarter ended Sept. 29 , on previously reported operating problems in its Electron Devices & Systems Group . ### For the full fiscal year , Varian posted a 13 % profit rise to $ 31.5 million , or $ 1.53 a share , up from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.27 a share , last year . ### Sales for the year rose almost 15 % to $ 1.34 billion from $ 1.17 billion last year . ### A profit last year in both the quarter and year included a net gain of $ 9.6 million , or 44 cents a share , from the sale of a division . ### Additionally , the full-year profit last year reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $ 22.8 million , or $ 1.04 a share . ### Shares of Varian , which last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge , closed at $ 22.75 , down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . ### Sales rose 18 % in the fiscal fourth quarter to $ 364.1 million from $ 307.9 million on the strength in semiconductors and other products . ### In a last-ditch effort to keep its sales force and customer base , Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed in principle to transfer ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary to two of its top executives . ### The financial-services firm , struggling since summer to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing after missing interest payments on about $ 1 billion of debt , will retain the right to regain the subsidiary . ### It said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses . ### It also can sell the right to regain the subsidiary to another party . ### Also , the broker-dealer subsidiary , Integrated Resources Equity Corp. , was renamed Royal Alliance Associates Inc . ### Because of Integrated 's widely reported troubles , the unit 's representatives had been requesting a name change . ### Royal Alliance , to which the 3,900 representatives ' licenses will be transferred , is a shell company Integrated owns . ### In the transaction , Integrated will transfer 100 % ownership of the subsidiary to Gerard M. Lavin , executive vice president of Integrated and head of back-office operations at the subsidiary , and Gary W. Krat , executive vice president of the parent and president of the subsidiary . ### Integrated will pump $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million into Royal Alliance as initial funding . ### In an interview , Mr. Krat said that based on criteria yet to be determined , he expects to distribute 49 % of Royal Alliance to the representatives , who sell Integrated 's insurance and mutual-fund products . ### If Integrated regains Royal Alliance , the representatives will retain their 49 % ownership . ### Mr. Krat indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks , and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if Integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime . ### The subsidiary is n't expected to be profitable for at least one year . ### If Integrated regains the unit , it would receive any profit the unit reports , even while the unit is independent . ### If the deal closes , the two officers will draw salaries from the independent operation , not from Integrated . ### Many aspects of the agreement were worked out Wednesday in Chicago , when Integrated senior managers met with about 150 representatives . ### `` I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive , '' said Stephen D. Weinroth , chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated . ### Integrated made its announcement after the market closed . ### In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading , Integrated shares closed at $ 1.125 , up 12.5 cents . ### The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges . ### The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August , prompting the Bank of Canada to sell the Canadian currency on the market . ### Traders say that after a week of nervously tracking every development on Wall Street , the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data . ### They noted , however , that a 26-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day . ### In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8578 marks late Friday , and at 141.90 yen , down from 142.43 yen late Friday . ### Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6030 , up from $ 1.5885 late Friday . ### In Tokyo Tuesday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen , down from Monday 's Tokyo close of 142.40 yen . ### The market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product , due out Thursday , which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace . ### The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , but still fairly strong . ### Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected . ### Many contend that the report may overstate the economy 's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to come . ### `` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says Walter Simon , an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co . ### `` Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8 % to 2.9 % -- wo n't alter the market 's view that the economy is softening . '' ### Hubert Pedroli , managing director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York , adds , `` The market sees this as the last piece of good news . '' ### Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator , a measure of inflation , is expected to slow , which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates . ### Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter . ### They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum . ### A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say . ### `` Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing , '' says one senior New York dealer . ### If we 're not headed for a recession , we 're certainly headed for a major slowdown . '' ### While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders , scheduled for release today , participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment . ### U.S. durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of 1.2 % in September , according to economists . ### The anticipated drop follows a 3.9 % rise in August . ### Traders , however , are quick to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for buying dollars , the U.S. unit has found a `` natural bottom '' at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen . ### Its resilience around these levels is pegged to persistent investor demand for the greenback , especially in Japan . ### On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367 an ounce , down 30 cents . ### Estimated volume was a very light one million ounces . ### In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday , gold was quoted at $ 366.79 an ounce . ### Liz Claiborne Inc. , New York , said its third-quarter net income jumped 62 % , citing continued strength in apparel sales and the start of shipments of its new product lines : a men 's fragrance , large-size women 's apparel and casual knitwear . ### The big apparel maker and retailer said that its net income in the latest quarter increased to $ 51.1 million , or 58 cents a share , from $ 31.7 million , or 36 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Sales in the quarter gained 29 % to $ 410.4 million from $ 317.7 million a year earlier . ### Claiborne shares closed yesterday at $ 25.125 , up 50 cents , in national over-the-counter trading . ### Claiborne 's directors also declared its regular cash dividend payment of five cents a share payable on Dec. 5 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 13 . ### For the nine months , net income rose 48 % to $ 124.2 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 83.8 million , or 96 cents a share a year earlier . ### Sales gained 16 % to $ 1.03 billion from $ 894 million . ### Tokyo stocks closed firmer Monday , with the Nikkei index making its fifth consecutive daily gain . ### Stocks also rose in London , while the Frankfurt market was mixed . ### In Tokyo , the Nikkei index added 99.14 to 35585.52 . ### The index moved above 35670 at midmorning , nearly reaching the record of 35689.98 set Sept. 28 . ### But the market lost part of the early gains on index-linked investment trust fund selling . ### In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday , the Nikkei index rose 1.08 points to 35586.60 . ### On Monday , traders noted that some investors took profits against the backdrop of the Nikkei 's fast-paced recovery following its plunge last Monday in reaction to the Oct. 13 drop in New York stock prices . ### But overall buying interest remained strong through Monday , with many observers saying they expect the Nikkei to continue with moderate gains this week . ### Turnover remained relatively small . ### Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares , down from 1.03 billion shares Friday . ### The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 7.81 at 2687.53 . ### Relatively stable foreign currency dealings Monday were viewed favorably by market players , traders said . ### But institutional investors may wait a little longer to appraise the direction of the U.S. monetary policy and the dollar , traders said . ### Hiroyuki Wada , general manager of the stock department at Okasan Securities , said Monday 's trading was `` unfocused . '' ### He said investors were picking individual stocks based on specific incentives and the likelihood of a wider price increase over the short term . ### The selective approach blurred themes such as domestic-demand issues , large-capitalization issues or high-technology shares , which had been providing at least some trading direction over the past few weeks , Mr. Wada said . ### Investors took profits on major construction shares , which advanced last week , shifting their attention to some midsize companies such as Aoki Corp. , Tobishima and Maeda . ### Aoki gained 60 yen to 1,480 yen -LRB- $ 10.40 -RRB- . ### Some pharmaceutical shares were popular on rumors related to new products to be introduced at a cancer conference that opened in Nagoya . ### Teijin was up 15 at 936 , and Kyowa Hakko gained 30 to 1,770 . ### Mochida advanced 40 to 4,440 . ### Fujisawa continued to attract investors because of strong earning prospects stemming from a new immune control agent . ### Fujisawa gained 50 to 2,060 . ### Kikkoman was up 30 to 1,600 , receiving investor interest for its land property holdings near Tokyo , a trader said . ### London prices closed modestly higher in the year 's thinnest turnover , a condition that underscored a lack of conviction ahead of a U.K. balance of payments report Tuesday . ### Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous , but dealers added that the day 's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities . ### They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain 's current account imbalance ca n't be much worse than the near record deficits seen in July and August . ### `` It 's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell , '' a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said . ### It 's better to wait . '' ### The Financial Times 100-share index finished 10.6 points higher at 2189.7 . ### The 30-share index closed 11.6 points higher at 1772.6 . ### Volume was 276.8 million shares , beneath the year 's previous low of 280.5 million shares Sept. 25 , the session before the August trade figures were released . ### Analysts ' expectations suggest a September current account deficit of # 1.6 billion -LRB- $ 2.54 billion -RRB- , compared with August 's # 2.0 billion deficit . ### Dealers , however , said forecasts are broadly divergent with estimates ranging between # # billion ### `` The range of expectations is so broad , '' a dealer at another major U.K. brokerage firm said , `` the deficit may have to be nearer or above # 2 billion for it to have any impact on the market . '' ### Lucas Industries , a British automotive and aerospace concern , rose 13 pence to 614 pence after it said its pretax profit for the year rose 28 % . ### Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed narrowly mixed in quiet dealings after recovering most of their early losses . ### The DAX index eased 0.99 point to end at 1523.22 after falling 5.5 points early in the session . ### Brokers said the declines early in the day were partly caused by losses of the ruling Christian-Democratic Union in communal elections in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg . ### The start of a weeklong conference by the IG Metall metal worker union in Berlin is drawing attention to the impending wage negotiations , which could boost companies ' personnel costs next year , they said . ### But there was little selling pressure , and even small orders at the lower levels sufficed to bring the market back to Friday 's opening levels . ### Traders said the thin trading volume points to continued uncertainty by most investors following last Monday 's record 13 % loss . ### The market is still 4 % short of its level before the plunge , and analysts are n't sure how long it will take until the DAX has closed that gap . ### But Norbert Braeuer , chief trader at Hessische Landesbank Girozentrale -LRB- Helaba -RRB- , said he expects share prices to move upward in the coming weeks . ### Banking stocks were the major gainers Monday amid hope that interest rates have peaked , as Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank added 4 marks each to 664 marks -LRB- $ 357 -RRB- and 326 marks , respectively . ### Commerzbank gained 1 to 252.5 . ### Auto shares were mixed , as Daimler-Benz firmed 2 to 723 , Bayerische Motoren Werke lost the same amount to 554 , and Volkswagen inched down 1.4 to 451.6 . ### Elsewhere , prices closed higher in Amsterdam , lower in Zurich , Stockholm and Milan , mixed in Brussels and unchanged in Paris . ### Shares closed higher in Hong Kong , Singapore and Manila , and were lower in Sydney , Seoul and Taipei . ### Wellington was closed . ### Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva . ### To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 . ### The percentage change is since year-end . ### Last week 's best and worst performing stocks among those issues that make up 80 % of the world 's stock market capitalization -LRB- in local currency -RRB- ISSUE -LRB- COUNTRY -RRB- CLOSE ### Source : Morgan Stanley Capital Intl . ### Enviropact Inc. said it entered into an agreement in principle to sell its pump and tank division and drilling division to GSX Chemical Services for $ 4 million . ### The Miami-based environmental engineering concern said GSX Chemical also will assume about $ 1.6 million in debt related to those divisions . ### Further , GSX will buy $ 1 million of Enviropact common stock , at $ 2.625 a share , plus an option to acquire an additional $ 1.5 million of common at the same price , the company said . ### In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Enviropact closed at $ 3 a share , up 25 cents . ### Enviropact said the two divisions account for about $ 8 million of the company 's $ 20 million in annual revenue . ### The transaction is expected to close within about 20 days , the company added . ### Enviropact said the proceeds will be used as working capital for expansion and to pay its existing tax liability of about $ 1.5 million that was due Sept. 15 . ### GSX is a unit of Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. of Burlington , Canada . ### Monday , October 23 , 1989 ### The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions . ### PRIME RATE : 10 % . ### The base rate on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks . ### FEDERAL FUNDS : 8 % high , 8 % low , 8 % near closing bid , 8 % offered . ### Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $ 1 million or more . ### Source : Fulton Prebon -LRB- U.S.A . -RRB- Inc . ### DISCOUNT RATE : 7 % . ### The charge on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank . ### CALL MONEY : 9 % to 10 % . ### The charge on loans to brokers on stock exchange collateral . ### COMMERCIAL PAPER placed directly by General Motors Acceptance Corp. : 8.50 % 2 to 44 days ;

# million ### TW Services Inc. posted a $ 3.3 million third-quarter net loss , compared with a $ 24.9 million profit , reflecting $ 60 million of expenses related to its much-publicized proposed takeover by Coniston Partners . ### The per-share loss for the Paramus , N.J. , food-services concern totaled seven cents , compared with earnings of 51 cents a share a year earlier . ### Revenue rose 5 % to $ 981.7 million from $ 934.7 million . ### Coniston , a New York investment partnership , awaits a vote by TW 's shareholders , scheduled for Friday , on Coniston 's $ 34-a-share , or $ 1.66 billion , offer for TW . ### Nine-month net income dropped 47 % to $ 26.3 million or , , $ 1.02 a share . ### Revenue rose 6 % to $ 2.79 billion from $ 2.63 billion . ### Cummins Engine Co. , Columbus , Ind. , hurt by a drop in engine orders from heavy-truck makers , reported a third-quarter loss of $ 39.7 million , or $ 4.12 a share , on essentially flat sales of $ 807.6 million . ### In the year-earlier period , the maker of diesel engines and parts had a narrower deficit of $ 17.6 million , or $ 1.84 a share , with sales of $ 808.3 million . ### A spokeswoman said shipments of truck engines , which provide a higher margin than most of the company 's other products , declined 16 % from a year earlier . ### Although Cummins 's stock stumbled last month after the company projected a `` substantial '' third-period loss , the stock also fell $ 1.125 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday , to $ 51.75 . ### It traded as high as $ 64 a month ago , before the loss projection . ### For the nine months , the latest loss trimmed net income to $ 3.6 million , which after payment of preferred dividends represented a 31-cent loss a common share . ### The year-before loss was $ 8.4 million , or $ 1.36 a common share . ### Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill . ### The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies . ### The state 's suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound . ### That suit and Exxon 's countersuit were filed in a state court in Anchorage . ### Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed . ### Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $ 1 billion . ### Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years . ### Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state 's conduct . ### The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef . ### Craig Tillery , an Alaska assistant attorney general , said in an interview last night that Exxon 's accusations `` are not new . ### Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue . ### The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . '' ### Since the spill last March , Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage . ### Exxon claims that use of dispersants , which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets , was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill . ### The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard . ### The state 's opposition to the use of dispersants , Exxon says , caused the Coast Guard `` to delay granting permission . '' ### Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway . ### Use of dispersants was approved when a test on the third day showed some positive results , officials said . ### Meson Investment Ltd. , a Vancouver , B.C.-based investment firm , said it raised its stake in Verit Industries to 8.9 % of the common shares outstanding . ### In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Meson said it holds 67,400 Verit common shares , including net purchases of 8,100 shares bought from Oct. 10 , 1988 , to Oct. 11 , 1989 , for $ 3.875 to $ 7 each . ### Meson is the personal holding company of Steven Morfey , a Vancouver securities dealer . ### He said the transaction was made for investment purposes . ### Officials for Sun Valley , Calif.-based Verit could n't be reached for comment . ### In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , Verit closed unchanged yesterday at $ 3.875 a share . ### The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $ 2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo . ### The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration , but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $ 1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds . ### By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- and his party 's largest state delegation in the House . ### `` I have no regrets about going forward , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio -LRB- D.,Calif. -RRB- , who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting . ### `` We are the Golden State , '' Mr. Fazio said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . '' ### The $ 2.85 billion package incorporates $ 500 million for small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . ### The funding is attached to a stopgap bill to keep most of the government operating through Nov. 15 . ### The measure is expected to come before the House today , and Congress is under pressure to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow , when the current continuing resolution expires . ### Given California 's size and political importance , the White House is eager to appear generous . ### But in private meetings yesterday , Budget Director Richard Darman argued that only $ 1.5 billion in new federal appropriations are needed to supplement existing resources . ### A White House budget office analysis estimates that $ 500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California 's needs , and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration . ### `` Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we 've got to address it , '' said Mr. Darman , who came to the Capitol to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session . ### I would hope very much that we would n't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat . '' ### Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans , no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten . ### A master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $ 2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative . ### When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $ 3.84 billion plan , Mr. Whitten insisted that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel 's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the delegation . ### On the chairman 's motion , the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it . ### More important than money in many cases are waivers California is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds , such as a $ 100 million cap on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year . ### Mr. Whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months . ### A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator , Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by California 's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel . ### The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands , and lumber interests sought to add another $ 100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina . ### California 's high-priced real estate puts it in an awkward position , too . ### One provision last night would have raised the cap on disaster loans to $ 500,000 from $ 100,000 per household to accommodate San Francisco losses . ### Kurzweil Music Systems Inc. said it retained Kidder , Peabody & Co. to study financial alternatives , including the possible sale of the financially struggling company . ### Kurzweil , Waltham , Mass. , makes digital electronic keyboard instruments used by professional recording musicians . ### It recently introduced a line for the home market . ### However , Raymond C. Kurzweil , chairman and chief executive , said `` The company continues to require additional funding to realize the potential of its technology . '' ### In the year 's first six months , Kurzweil had a loss of $ 6.9 million on sales of $ 11.2 million . ### Last month its president , John S. Donnelly , resigned citing `` management differences '' with Mr. Kurzweil . ### Amtech Systems Inc. , Tempe , Ariz. , said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate `` substantial improvement '' over the previous fiscal year . ### Amtech , which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers , said profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $ 800,000 from $ 446,000 last year . ### Per-share earnings are estimated at more than 40 cents , up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988 . ### Total revenue is expected to double to more than $ 22 million from $ 10.8 million . ### Amtech , which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace , defense , computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas , said its final audited results are due in late November . ### The company attributed the improvement to strong demand in the semiconductor equipment segment as well as the acquisition of Echelon Service Co. and the inclusion of a full year 's results of operations for RTS Inc. , compared with seven months ' results for the prior year . ### LDI Corp. , Cleveland , said it will offer $ 50 million in commercial paper backed by lease-rental receivables . ### The program matches funds raised from the sale of the commercial paper with small to medium-sized leases . ### LDI termed the paper `` non-recourse financing , '' meaning that investors would be repaid from the lease receivables , rather than directly by LDI Corp . ### LDI leases and sells data-processing , telecommunications and other high-tech equipment . ### SHEVARDNADZE ADMITTED that Moscow violated the 1972 ABM treaty . ### In a foreign-policy address before the Soviet legislature , the foreign minister conceded that the radar station in Krasnoyarsk breached the superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and said it would be dismantled . ### Shevardnadze said it took Gorbachev 's government four years to determine that the station 's location in Siberia violated the accord , as Western arms-control officials have long contended . ### He also denounced Moscow 's nine-year involvement in the war in Afghanistan , saying it involved `` gross violations of... civil norms and ethics . '' ### Secretary of State Baker , in his first major arms-control speech , called for a new military relationship with Moscow to reduce `` first strike '' nuclear arms . ### BAY AREA COMMUTERS BATTLED earthquake-related transportation snarls . ### Travelers crowded into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited for buses in the rain , but the massive gridlock anticipated by officials in the San Francisco Bay area never materialized . ### As the death toll from last week 's temblor climbed to 61 , the condition of freeway survivor Buck Helm , who spent four days trapped under rubble , improved , hospital officials said . ### Rescue crews , however , gave up hope that others would be found alive under the collapsed roadway . ### The House Appropriations Committee approved a $ 2.85 billion aid package for the quake region , less than the $ 3.8 billion sought by California officials . ### Hungary declared itself a democracy and for the first time openly commemorated the anniversary of the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising that was crushed by the Soviet Union . ### A crowd estimated at 100,000 held a torch-lit march through Budapest as Acting President Szuros delivered a nationally televised address rejecting communist dominance . ### About 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig and thousands more staged protests in three other cities in a fresh challenge to the Communist leadership to introduce democratic freedoms . ### In an East Berlin suburb , meanwhile , employees at an electronics plant formed an independent trade union called Reform , a worker spokesman said . ### The space shuttle Atlantis landed at a desert air strip at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , ending a five-day mission that dispatched the Jupiter-bound Galileo space probe . ### The five astronauts returned to Earth about three hours early because high winds had been predicted at the landing site . ### Fog shrouded the base before touchdown . ### Explosions shook a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near Pasadena , Texas , hurling debris and causing a fire visible from 10 miles away . ### More than 100 people were injured , and a number of workers were missing . ### Parts of the Houston Ship Channel were closed . ### The White House said Bush is conferring with leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee to ease differences over guidelines for CIA agents . ### The statement came after officials said Bush complained at a private meeting last week that a strict interpretation of a policy requires the U.S. to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plots . ### Lebanon 's Gen. Aoun placed Christian military forces on alert in case of renewed fighting with Syrian-backed Moslems after Lebanon 's two main Shiite militias rejected an Arab-sponsored peace accord . ### The plan , approved by lawmakers and rejected Sunday by Aoun , includes political changes aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war . ### NATO defense ministers are expected to call for a reduction in nuclear forces in Europe when the alliance 's nuclear planning group convenes a two-day session today in Portugal . ### The ministers are to reshape NATO 's defenses in Western Europe amid fast-paced changes in the Soviet bloc . ### Iran 's President Rafsanjani offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets . ### Washington rejected the bid , saying the hostages were n't linked to other issues . ### PLO leader Arafat asked Egypt to seek clarifications from the U.S. on Secretary of State Baker 's plan for Mideast peace talks , an aide to Egyptian President Mubarak said . ### The official stressed that the PLO has n't rejected the five-point formula . ### Commonwealth leaders turned to issues ranging from drugs to the world economy after Zimbabwe 's President Mugabe called Thatcher 's views on South Africa `` despicable . '' ### At a meeting in Malaysia , Australia and Canada also assailed the British prime minister for criticizing the 49-nation group 's call for Pretoria to ease apartheid . ### CMS Enhancements Inc. said it estimates that sales and earnings for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 fell somewhat from the year-earlier period . ### Jim Farooquee , chief executive officer of the Tustin , Calif. , computer accessories supplier , said he was `` comfortable '' with analysts ' expectations that CMS would earn between six cents and eight cents a share on revenue of about $ 42 million . ### A year earlier , CMS posted profit of $ 1.1 million , or 13 cents a share , on sales of $ 48 million . ### This time , there are 30 % more shares outstanding . ### Mr. Farooquee attributed the decline to an industrywide softening of demand for computer enhancement products . ### Property Capital Trust said it dropped its plan to liquidate because it was n't able to realize the value it had expected . ### It said it will buy back two million shares , or 18.4 % , of the total outstanding , and continue operations buying and managing real estate . ### Property Capital , which is based in Boston , had told shareholders it expected to distribute at least $ 21 a share , or $ 229 million , in a liquidation , based on an expected asset sale price of $ 290 million or more . ### The company said it did n't receive an offer it wanted to accept . ### As a result of dropping the liquidation plan , shareholders will have to treat dividends received this year as ordinary income or capital gains rather than as tax free returns of capital , the company said . ### The share repurchase will be funded mostly from borrowings . ### A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share , in the third quarter , more than four times its profit of $ 663,000 , or three cents a share , last year . ### Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company 's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share , or approximately $ 2 million . ### Belo said it increased its effective tax rate to 52 % from 47 % to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988 . ### The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents , or approximately $ 2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding . ### For the third quarter , Belo said its revenue increased 11 % , to $ 101.5 million from $ 91.2 million last year . ### For the nine months , the company had net income of $ 15.1 million , or 74 cents a share , up 98 % from $ 7.6 million , or 38 cents a share last year . ### Revenue grew almost 8 % to $ 301.9 million from $ 279.8 million last year . ### A federal judge granted a temporary stay of the California Student Aid Commission 's emergency action to stop guaranteeing loans for National Technical Schools , a unit of United Education & Software Inc . ### The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards , and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations . ### United Education & Software , a Los Angeles education services company , called the commission 's action `` precipitous and unwarranted . '' ### The court set a hearing on the emergency action for Oct. 30 . ### United Education & Software posted a $ 250,000 bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in guaranteeing any more loans for National Technical Schools students prior to the hearing . ### A decline in Allied-Signal Inc. 's automotive business contributed to flat sales and only slightly higher earnings in the third quarter . ### Allied-Signal reported that net rose 1.7 % to $ 121 million , or 81 cents a share , from $ 119 million , or 80 cents a share , the year earlier . ### Sales slipped 1.3 % to $ 2.82 billion from $ 2.86 billion . ### For the nine months , the Morris Township , N.J.-based company , with businesses in aerospace , automotive products and engineered materials , earned $ 413 million , or $ 2.77 cents a share , up 15 % from $ 359 million , or $ 2.40 a share . ### Sales eased 0.2 % to $ 8.88 billion from $ 8.90 billion . ### Chairman Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said that a drop in sales of auto and truck parts contributed to lower earnings in the automotive unit . ### He also cited unfavorable foreign-exchange rates and a lower tax rate . ### Earnings for the group declined to $ 11 million from $ 33 million last year . ### Earnings at Allied-Signal 's aerospace business rose to $ 55 million from $ 41 million a year ago , primarily on higher sales and profit in its engines and auxiliary power units . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Allied-Signal shares closed at $ 35.125 , off 87.5 cents . ### The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it will start enforcing stiffer regulations Jan. 31 for so-called gray-market imports of vehicles . ### The regulations , required under legislation enacted by Congress last year , will apply to imports of vehicles that were n't built to meet U.S. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in Europe or elsewhere abroad . ### U.S. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year , a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the U.S. each year . ### According to the NHTSA , the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the U.S. government , or a person who has a contract with a registered importer , from permanently importing a vehicle that does n't meet the U.S. auto safety standards . ### The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the U.S. safety standards , compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the U.S. standards . ### Congress tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after U.S. auto dealers , including franchised foreign-car dealers , complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars could n't meet U.S. auto safety standards . ### Legent Corp. said it expects to report net income between $ 6.4 million and $ 6.9 million , or between 32 cents and 34 cents a share , for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 . ### In the year-ago quarter , the software developer reported pro forma earnings of $ 4.8 million , or 24 cents a share . ### Vienna , Va.-based Legent said it expects to post revenue for the quarter of more than $ 31 million , compared with pro forma revenue of $ 25.2 million in 1988 . ### For the fiscal year , the company said it anticipates reporting earnings of $ 23 million , or about $ 1.15 a share , including a charge of about $ 5.9 million , or 22 cents a share , related to the merger that created Legent out of Duquesne Systems Inc. and Morino Inc. in March 1989 . ### Revenue for fiscal 1989 is expected to exceed $ 124 million . ### Pro forma earnings for fiscal 1988 were $ 19.6 million , or 99 cents a share , on revenue of $ 97.2 million . ### The company attributed much of the growth in earnings to increased demand for its systems productivity software . ### Archive Corp. said it expects to report net income for its fiscal year ended Sept. 29 of a record $ 15 million , or $ 1.15 a share , up 43 % from $ 10.5 million , or 80 cents a share , for the prior year . ### The Costa Mesa , Calif. , maker of computer tape drives also projected record revenue for the year of $ 181 million , up from $ 122.7 million for the previous year . ### Archive attributed the gains to strong demand for its products , continued growth of the reseller market and the acquisition of Maynard Electronics in February , which accounted for about 14 % of the company 's revenue . ### Detrex Corp. said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio plant reduced its third-quarter net income by $ 1.9 million . ### Detrex , which has annual sales of about $ 100 million , declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter . ### The Southfield , Mich.-based company earned $ 774,000 in the quarter last year . ### Detrex is setting aside $ 3.1 million for the cleanup , but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $ 1.9 million because of tax considerations . ### In addition , the manufacturer said it signed a consent decree with Ohio to build a $ 1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1 , 1990 . ### Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex 's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $ 48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute ### First Executive Corp. said about 96 % of the rights to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised . ### Of the 17.6 million rights units issued , just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering , the insurance holding company said . ### Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder , Peabody & Co. , which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units . ### First Executive said the offering will raise about $ 299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business . ### In addition , analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding . ### Each of the units consists of two warrants , each of which could be used to purchase a half-share of common stock , and one depositary preference share . ### Depositary shares are convertible into common stock on a 1-to-1 basis . ### Currently , the company has about 88.1 million common shares outstanding . ### In over-the-counter trading Monday , the stock closed at $ 10.625 , off 37.5 cents . ### UNITED AIR'S PARENT quashed any

that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants . ### The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged under the racketeering law , a senior department official said . ### Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said . ### The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines , Mr. Runkel said . ### The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law . ### Under that law , defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a `` criminal enterprise '' may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise . ### The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers . ### They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged . ### The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said . ### `` That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business , you do n't attempt to seize the whole business ; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime , '' he explained . ### In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said . ### It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress , let alone within the same party . ### Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez . ### It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez , who is investigating the $ 2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association . ### But instead of thanks , Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality . ### `` Every witness receives a formal subpoena , '' Rep. Gonzalez told him . ### Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate , where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , Charles Keating Jr. , principal stockholder of Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. of Phoenix , Ariz . ### At the first day of the House Banking Committee 's hearings last week , William Seidman , chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts , said the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions . ### Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers . ### Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to `` subvert '' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating . ### Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper . ### `` When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions , then that 's a no-no in my book , '' the Texas lawmaker says . ### And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously . ### Unless the questions are answered , I will keep on going . '' ### Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties . ### In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal , for example , Rep. Thomas Lantos , the California Democrat who led the hearings , tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato , a New York Republican . ### But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick . ### He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman , a bank-baiting Texas populist who chaired the Banking Committee until 1974 . ### Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open . ### Early in his political career , as a city councilman in San Antonio , he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced , denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a `` bat-roost meeting . '' ### The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez 's inquiry is Danny Wall , chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision . ### As the principal regulator of the thrift industry , Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly . ### Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca . ### Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988 . ### Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance . ### `` I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness , and by God I 'm not going to tolerate it , '' he says . ### Mr. Wall , however , is a self-proclaimed `` child of the Senate '' and former staff director of its Banking Committee . ### An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others , Sens. Dennis DeConcini -LRB- D. , Ariz. -RRB- , John McCain -LRB- R. , Ariz. -RRB- , John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- and Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich . -RRB- . ### They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years . ### `` I 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names -LCB- of the senators -RCB- will be brought out , '' Mr. Gonzalez says . ### This is raising eyebrows . ### `` When I first got a glimpse at the witness list , I could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this , '' says Michael Waldman , director of Congress Watch , a consumer group . ### There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . '' ### And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks , `` I too am astounded by it , because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position . '' ### All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent . ### Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix , and the California thrift 's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan . ### Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle , his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . ### `` He 's wise , he 's good and I know he 's an honest man , '' the Texan says . ### But at the same time , Mr. Gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S* bailout legislation during the summer . ### The Senate negotiators included Sens. Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall 's principal sponsor , Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah . ### They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall 's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L . ### Most importantly , the Senate traded away the Bush administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout , which was partly reinstated later . ### At the time , Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they `` could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn 's insistence on Wall . '' ### Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway , under the guise of the Lincoln investigation . ### `` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. Gonzalez concedes . ### Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout . ### Mr. Keating raised $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering . ### He recently voted `` present '' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify , then changed his vote to yes . ### But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others . ### Rep. Jim Leach -LRB- R. , Iowa -RRB- says the Lincoln S&L affair is `` the biggest bank heist in history , '' and adds : `` The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making . '' ### A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally . ### But the witness , William Crawford , California 's chief state thrift regulator , denies saying that . ### `` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone interview yesterday . ### But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions . ### The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall 's predecessor , Edwin Gray . ### He has characterized the five senators ' roles as `` tantamount to an attempt to subvert the... regulatory process , '' and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting . ### So the senators must brace themselves . ### Sen. Cranston , as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in San Francisco , sighed to an aide : `` Well , back to Keatingland . ### When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago , they started life in Los Angeles with only $ 400 . ### They 'd actually left the Soviet Union with $ 480 , but during a stop in Italy Ms. Volokh dropped $ 80 on a black velvet suit . ### Not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the American way . ### Three months after she arrived in L.A. she spent $ 120 she did n't have for a hat . ### -LRB- `` A `` A turban , '' she specifies , `` though it was n't the time for that 14 years ago . ### But I loved turbans . '' -RRB- ### Since then she has become wealthy . ### Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981 , when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $ 10 million . ### Most recently , she has become the publisher of Movieline , a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month , with an initial press run of 100,000 copies . ### Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News , the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair 's gossipy archness and Premiere 's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae , with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter . ### It 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores . ### Though Ms. Volokh is a small woman , she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in Hollywood . ### Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev , when she lived with her parents , her husband and her two sons in a 2 apartment in what she calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape . ### Now , for example , she owns 48 hats . ### However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel . ### With obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : `` No darling , I just give it a Chanel look . '' ### She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox . ### Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona , along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes , the parties she throws for 500 people , the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara ? ### `` No , darling , '' she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East to promote Movieline 's national expansion . ### You have to be born with it . ### I used to wear hats in Russia , but I had to make them and my dresses . ### On the hat side I was n't getting what I wanted . '' ### Now 48 years old , Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants . ### At Movieline , she wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek . '' ### In restaurants -LRB- in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres -RRB- , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room . ### `` You people here think this is Russian music , '' she said with disdain , and called over to the waitress : `` Could you turn it off ? '' ### That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties . ### `` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik -LRB- `` a `` a little well done , but very good '' -RRB- . ### If you are born to give parties , you give parties . ### Even in Russia we managed to give parties . ### In Los Angeles , in our lean years , we gave parties . '' ### As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies , Ms. Volokh sees her party-giving as an important part of business . ### She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings . ### At American cocktail parties everyone 's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next . ### I like rather tea , because it is at the end of the day . '' ### She serves high Russian tea , at 5 p.m . ### It 's supposed to be later but I just moved it . ### In Los Angeles , it 's important to catch people just after work . '' ### She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . '' ### Guests bring movies on tape , and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs ' art-nouveau library -LRB- `` the pleasure dome '' -RRB- . ### They eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain their clips . ### `` It 's very revealing and soul baring , '' said Ms. Volokh . ### The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs , Boris Krutchensky -LRB- who has the title of co-publisher -RRB- , and Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co-editor . ### Mr. Krutchensky approached Ms. Volokh five years ago about backing the publication , which started out as a listing guide . ### She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well . ### `` Anne does n't believe in blandness , '' said Ms. Smith . ### She wants things to be exciting . ### And she has this inexhaustible energy . ### She 'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible , then she 'll have us make it work . '' ### In fact , Ms. Volokh was n't just a rich lady who needed a hobby . ### Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia . ### Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` The Art of Russian Cuisine , '' brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co . ### `` I do n't trust people who do n't eat , '' said Ms. Volokh , though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds . ### Look at Dostoevski and Kafka . ### No one ever eats in their books and look at them . ### Tolstoy 's characters eat , Pushkin 's , Gogol 's . '' ### In her cookbook , which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month -LRB- with the blini recipe revised so it works -RRB- , she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature : Pushkin on blini , Goncharov on piroghi . ### In life , she offers practical dieting advice : `` Divide your meals into important and unimportant . ### In a great restaurant , do n't deprive yourself . ### The other meals do n't matter . '' ### Amusing as she is , and frivolous as she can seem , this is a serious person with some difficult memories . ### She was the child of relative privilege . ### Her mother was a translator ; her father was `` the eternal vice director . '' ### `` I emigrated to wear better hats , do better parties , '' she said with a giggle . ### But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one . ### You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances . ### One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . '' ### By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R. Ms. Volokh quit her job , to remove herself from the public eye . ### The wait was miserable . ### Before granting Ms. Volokh 's parents a visa , the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband , whom she had divorced 38 years earlier . ### Mr. Volokh was fired from his job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities . ### The Volokhs were afraid that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk . ### They did n't . ### Their visa came in relatively short order , and they moved to Los Angeles . ### Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field , but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available a Russian who spoke fluent English . ### `` That 's always looking back , '' she said . ### I wanted to be in business . '' ### On the way to that goal , she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry , attended secretarial school , then went to work for a fund-raising organization . ### Soon she was running the office . ### When her husband and son founded their computer company , Vesoft , she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist . ### Now Movieline is located in the same building as Vesoft . ### `` Things work out unexpectedly in life , '' said Ms. Volokh . ### You never know if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one . ### We were lucky . ### William D. Forrester , president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council , has a warning for U.S. companies trying to do business in the Soviet Union . ### `` It 's an extremely complex market , and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment , '' Mr. Forrester says . ### We are not trying to encourage everyone . '' ### Undeterred by such words of caution , corporate America is flocking to Moscow , lured by a huge untapped market and Mikhail Gorbachev 's attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy . ### Doing business with the Russians , once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans , has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp. , Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. , as well as a cluster of smaller firms . ### Reflecting the new-found interest , more than 140 U.S. companies are taking part in a Moscow exhibition organized by Mr. Forrester 's trade group . ### But while U.S. interest may be big and growing , the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating . ### Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy , Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika , the restructuring of the Soviet economy . ### Executives say Mr. Gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities . ### Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players , many who promise more than they can deliver . ### And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics . ### `` You have to go out to all your constituents , '' says James H. Giffen , who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market , involving investment of more than $ 5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures . ### As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying . ### Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans . ### Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p . A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants . ### The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists , and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped . ### Whatever the difficulties , Mr. Gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade . ### For political as well as economic reasons , U.S. companies are at the top of his priorities -- a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the U.S. trade show last week . ### Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards , Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade , which now amounts to a meager $ 3 billion annually . ### The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures , behind West Germany , Finland and Italy . ### According to several people present at the meeting , Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S. , possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush . ### Judging by the crush at the exhibition , deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for U.S. products . ### Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste , a commodity in chronically short supply here . ### And unruly crowds at RJR Nabisco Inc. 's booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free Camel cigarette sticker . ### Some U.S. products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program . ### Both Colgate and Procter & Gamble have received big orders for toothpaste , soap and detergents . ### The American Trade Consortium says it is planning to ship some $ 500 million of consumer goods , financed by bank credits , in the first few months of next year . ### But the current Soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair . ### The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive . ### Because the Soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars , marks and other Western currencies , companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction . ### International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however . ### Shelley M. Zeiger , an entrepreneur from New Jersey who buys Soviet porcelain and `` matryoshka '' nesting dolls for export to the U.S. , says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items . ### Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project . ### Several medical concerns , including Pfizer Inc. , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach . ### `` It 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries , '' says Dennis A. Sokol , president of Medical Service Partners Inc. , who is putting the medical consortium together . ### Some U.S. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale . ### One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health . ### According to Richard P. Mills , a Boston-based official of the U.S. partner , 10,000 copies of the quarterly will be printed in Russian from next year . ### It will be financed by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English-language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements . ### `` We found a market niche , '' Mr. Mills boasts . ### It 's truly entrepreneurial . ### General Electric Co. was given an $ 89.6 million Navy contract for nuclear propulsion parts . ### Westinghouse Electric Corp. also won a $ 75.5 million Navy contract for nuclear propulsion parts . ### Federal Data Corp. was issued a $ 14.5 million Navy contract for computer systems . ### American Telephone & Telegraph Co. was awarded an $ 11.5 million Navy contract for oceanographic services . ### Cray Research Inc. said it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems , the Cray , to the United Kingdom Meteorological Office . ### The system is the first to be sold through the joint marketing agreement between Cray and Control Data Corp . ### The supercomputer , which lists for $ 18.5 million , will be installed in the first quarter of 1990 in the meteorological office 's headquarters in Bracknell , England . ### Shareholders of Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p . A. voted to accept a bid of 5,500 lire -LRB- $ 4.03 -RRB- a share by France 's Credit Agricole for 13.32 % of the bank , rejecting an earlier , equal offer by Italy 's Assicurazioni Generali S.p . A . ### The move will give Nuovo Banco a badly needed foreign presence , and make Credit Agricole the bank 's largest shareholder . ### It also opens a rift in the bank 's shareholders ' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern . ### Nuovo Banco will become Italy 's biggest private-sector bank when it completes its scheduled merger with Banca Cattolica del Venetoen by year end . ### Credit Agricole asked a Milan court to sequester the Nuovo Banco shares , the Italian news agency ANSA reported . ### The tribunal is scheduled to rule on the request Friday . ### No reason for the request was given . ### Credit Agricole officials could n't be immediately reached for comment . ### The decision to accept Credit Agricole 's bid , valued at 283.3 billion lire -LRB- $ 207.4 million -RRB- , came after a stormy weekend meeting . ### Nuovo Banco 's second largest shareholder , the Fiat S.p . A.-controlled investment concern , Gemina S.p . A. , fought to have Generali 's offer approved . ### Gemina , which owns 13.26 % of Nuovo Banco , abstained in the final vote on Credit Agricole , which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders . ### The linkup with Credit Agricole will give Nuovo Banco its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old Banco Ambrosiano , which collapsed amid scandal after the death of Chairman Roberto Calvi in 1982 . ### Since then , the bank has strengthened its Italian network , and has posted strong results . ### `` The shareholders felt we needed a foreign presence more than we needed links with an insurance company , '' an Ambrosiano spokeswoman said . ### Gemina said in a statement that `` it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate . '' ### A company spokeswoman said the company had n't decided what measures to take , but did n't rule out legal action . ### Generali , Italy 's biggest insurer , last month offered 5,500 lire a share for the Nuovo Banco stake held by Banco Popolare di Milano , the bank 's largest shareholder , which announced plans to sell the holdings earlier this year . ### A Generali spokesman declined to comment on Nuovo Banco 's rejection of the insurer 's offer . ### On the Milan stock exchange , Nuovo Banco 's shares jumped to 4,830 lire each from 4,695 lire Friday . ### Qintex Australia Ltd. , a media and resorts concern controlled by Australian entrepreneur Christopher Skase , announced a plan to restructure and sell assets to try to ease its financial problems . ### Mr. Skase , a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company , said in a statement that Qintex will sell its 51 % stake in its upscale Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii as well as three Australian television stations . ### The sales are expected to raise more than 600 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 462.2 million -RRB- , Mr. Skase said . ### Qintex Australia has n't disclosed its borrowings , but analysts estimate the company 's debt at A$ 1.2 billion . ### Mr. Skase also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of Qintex Australia with Qintex Ltd. , which owns 55 % of Qintex Australia . ### He said the move will `` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , '' but he did n't provide details of the merger . ### Company officials said over the weekend that Qintex Australia 's bank creditors have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the company , including a failed US$ 1.5 billion plan to buy Communications Co. , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , movie and television production concern . ### Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43%-owned U.S. affiliate , filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . ### Analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in Qintex Australia and force it to sell assets . ### The company 's latest moves were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment . ### Mr. Skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry . ### It said Qintex Entertainment owes Qintex Australia US$ 38.1 million in loans not secured by specific assets . ### Qintex Australia also said it has an investment of A$ 83.3 million in Qintex Entertainment shares . ### In the statement , Mr. Skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in Australia , the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A$ 120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities . ### In March , Qintex sold 49 % of the three Mirage resorts to Japan 's Nippon Shinpan Co. and Mitsui & Co. for A$ 433 million . ### Yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the Japanese companies will acquire Qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts . ### Before its shares were suspended from trading , Qintex Australia plunged to 16 Australian cents -LRB- 12 U.S. cents -RRB- a share yesterday from 33 Australian cents Friday . ### The shares traded at about A$ 1.50 in March , when the plan to acquire was announced . ### Qintex Ltd. shares sank to A$ 1.50 yesterday from A$ 3.05 Friday . ### Mr. Skase 's statement cited four recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by more than A$ 200 million . ### They were what he called an `` unlawful termination '' by of the acquisition agreement with Qintex , high Australian interest rates , a pilots ' strike at Australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company 's Australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional TV stations in Queensland state . ### has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and Qintex Australia has threatened a countersuit . ### Qintex Australia has n't yet reported results for the fiscal year ended July 31 . ### In his statement , Mr. Skase said preliminary accounts showed that group profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed A$ 170 million . '' ### He gave no further details . ### Shareholders ' funds as of July 31 were estimated at more than A$ 1 billion , Mr. Skase said , compared with A$ 725 million a year earlier . ### The company will make `` adequate provisions '' to cover costs of the dispute with and any loss from the investment in Qintex Entertainment , he said . ### Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty. , a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest . ### Qintex Australia paid the management company A$ 32.6 million in the latest fiscal year . ### Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services . ### Non-executive directors of Qintex Australia , who must approve payments to the senior executives , balked at the amount . ### Two of the directors resigned , Mr. Skase said , so the payments have n't yet been approved . ### Chip 's Memory Is Here Today , Here Tomorrow ### TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off . ### Today 's most widely used data-storing chips have `` volatile '' memories -- their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity , so they need external power supplies . ### National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them . ### The chips use materials , such as lead zirconate titanate , to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity . ### Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined . ### But Ramtron of Colorado Springs , Colo. , plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December . ### The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives . ### National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque , N.M . ### National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a 4-kilobit memory , next year . ### Once production hurdles are overcome , the chips could take over a significant part of the market . ### In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips . ### Military buyers have shown interest , National says , because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation . ### And while today 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds . ### Showing Up in Court Without Being There ### AN AUSTIN , Texas , company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town . ### Witnesses often must travel long distances to give face-to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters . ### That means huge travel bills . ### And telephone or videotape depositions just do n't match physical encounters . ### That could change , thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics . ### Video Telecom Corp. , which markets videoconferencing systems , is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television . ### The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines . ### And it is preparing to set up shop in Chicago , New York and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network . ### While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper . ### An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 , depending on the quality of the picture , to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities . ### Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection ### JAPAN'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers . ### Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables . ### Until now , most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them . ### But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan 's electronics industry when it accused Korea 's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips . ### A settlement was reached but was n't made public . -RRB- ### And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S. 's Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola 's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent . ### Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers . ### The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say Japan is starting to take . ### Hitachi made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in Texas after Motorola sued Hitachi for patent violation . ### Hitachi charges Motorola `` has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents '' used in Motorola 's MC68030 microprocessor chip . ### Translation : Motorola appears to have taken a Hitachi technology that is patented in the U.S. , Hitachi says , and `` tried to make it look like a new technology . '' ### Motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges . ### Odds and Ends ### COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by Japan 's Sharp Corp . ### They mimic the brain by `` looking '' at an image , extracting the fundamentals -- boundaries , corners and lines -- and translating them into computer data . ### Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features . ### An N.V . Philips unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems . ### Using reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , chips made by Intergraph of Huntsville , Ala. , the system splits the image it `` sees '' into 20 digital representations , each processed by one chip . ### Tandy Corp. , citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods , said net income dropped 3.3 % for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 . ### The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders . ### Tandy 's stock fell $ 1.375 a share to close at $ 44 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . ### Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier . ### The company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively repurchasing its shares , thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income . ### Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier . ### Revenue rose 5 % to $ 986 million from $ 937 million . ### Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products . ### `` Radio Shack continues to be lackluster , '' said Dennis Telzrow , analyst with Eppler , Guerin & Turner in Dallas . ### He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack . '' ### Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2 % in the quarter from a year earlier , he said . ### As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 . ### Tandy earned $ 88.8 million , or $ 3.64 a share , in the year ended June 30 . ### Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market . ### Tandy has added several new products to that line , including a laptop computer priced around $ 1,000 , and is focusing its advertising on the easy-to-use software that is packaged with its machines . ### Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter . ### `` They 've been promising 13 % to 15 % growth based on the strategic moves they 've made , '' he said . ### If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter . ### At a private dinner Thursday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America . ### Mr. Joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray , according to people familiar with the discussion . ### He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise . ### The dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $ 200 billion junk market . ### And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve . ### Amid the market disorder , even Drexel , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns . ### Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors . ### For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating . ### `` This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market , and it could take years before it 's over , '' says Mark Bachmann , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company . ### In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so . ### Since the end of last year , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe Treasury securities . ### The junk market , which mushroomed to $ 200 billion from less than $ 2 billion at the start of the decade , has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments . ### The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $ 3 billion in junk financing . ### Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale . ### At that point , the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell . ### In an interview , Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk . ### `` What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and , appropriately enough , quite quality-conscious , which is not at all bad , '' he says . ### Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . '' ### What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds . ### Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs . ### At closely held Deltec Securities Corp. , junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise . ### In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them . ### Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , Deltec said in a recent , grim report to customers . ### Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said . ### Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co. ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress . ### And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation . ### `` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' Deltec said . ### Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality . ### Meanwhile , Prudential , the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds , has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ 6.5 billion from $ 7 billion since August because of falling junk prices . ### `` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says James A. Gregoire , a managing director . ### I have no reason to think things will get worse , but this market has a knack for surprising us . ### This market teaches us to be humble . '' ### The junk market 's `` yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson , '' he says . ### Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says Stuart Reese , manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $ 17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio . ### But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse . ### And the risks are n't appropriate for us , '' he says . ### The big insurer , unlike Prudential , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds . ### The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say . ### `` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says Paul Asquith , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . ### Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings . ### His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34 % . ### One indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. Asquith says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 . ### These bonds , now rated single-D , include junk offerings by AP Industries , Columbia Savings -LRB- Colorado -RRB- , First Texas Savings Association , Gilbraltar Financial Corp. , Integrated Resources Inc. , Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. , Resorts International Inc. , Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc . ### `` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says Bradford Cornell , professor of finance at University of California 's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles . ### Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds . ### Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . '' ### Despite the junk market 's problems , Drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found . ### During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps . ### Still , the list of troubled Drexel bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street , as does its successful offerings . ### Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include Resorts International , Braniff , Integrated Resources , SCI TV , Gillette Holdings , Western Electric and Southmark . ### `` Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well , '' says Michael Holland , chairman of Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc . ### `` But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste . ### As Helen Boehm , who owns an art porcelain company , sipped her luncheon cocktail , she reeled off the names of a few pals -- Prince Charles , Princess Diana , Sarah Ferguson , John Kluge , Milton Petrie . ### Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz -LRB- `` my day diamond , darling '' -RRB- , she told her two companions that she is on the `` board '' of the Vatican Museum in Rome . ### As it turns out , the board has a lot of important members , including Winton Blount -LRB- former postmaster general of the U.S. -RRB- , Mrs. Henry Gaisman -LRB- widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor -RRB- and Vincent Murphy -LRB- an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co . -RRB- ### But Mrs. Boehm did n't mention any of them . ### `` Helen Boehm has a way with names , '' says James Revson , a gossip columnist for Newsday -LRB- and son of Joseph Revson , a founder of Revlon -RRB- . ### Like which are droppable and which are not . ### With the fall social season well under way , name-droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers . ### But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids . ### In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . -RRB- ### `` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele . ### It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society . ### It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . '' ### Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met Liza Minnelli . ### I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks . ### I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was Liza . ### So I said , ` Hello . ' ### And she said , ` Hello . ' ### Can you imagine ? ### Liza said hello to me . '' ### Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse . ### `` They ca n't help talking about the big important people they know , even if they do n't really know them , '' says Dr. Freudenberger . ### Beauregard Houston-Montgomery , a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980 , is an inveterate name-dropper . ### `` I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , '' he says . ### Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol . ### `` I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , '' says Steven Greenberg , publisher of Fame . ### After all , Warhol was the ultimate namedropper , dropping five a day in his diaries . ### And Beauregard was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing . '' ### Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes , publisher of Forbes magazine -LRB- `` We've been in the columns together '' -RRB- , Mary Boone , a New York art dealer -LRB- `` I `` I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure `` -RRB- and Bridget Fonda , the actress -LRB- `` She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends '' -RRB- . ### Mr. Revson , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party . ### These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher . ### `` They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , '' says Mr. Revson . ### It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . '' ### But name-dropping has other benefits , often civic . ### In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer . ### Take Cleveland . ### It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock'n ' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant . ### Some people call it `` The Mistake on the Lake '' -- Lake Erie , that is . ### `` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths . ### Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in `` The Wizard Of Oz , '' once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . ### `` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says . ### In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous . ### `` Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , '' says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real-estate agency . ### Most people ca n't even remember his name . '' ### It is John Hart . -RRB- ### Mr. Rambo says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced at $ 4 million because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there . ### `` If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , '' says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains . ### Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers . ### And some even do it with malice aforethought . ### Len Kessler , a financial publicist in New York , sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him . ### He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis . ### He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions . ### `` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler says . ### There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name-dropping . ### Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud . ### `` Get caught and you 're dead in the water , '' says Mr. Thal . ### Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor , a client , `` hates being called ` Liz . ' ### If directors or producers phone me and say they know ` Liz , ' I know they 've never met her . ### She prefers ` Elizabeth . ' '' ### In New York society , Pat Buckley , the very social wife of author William Buckley , has the nicknames `` Mrs. Buckles '' and `` Patsy . '' ### And her husband sometimes calls her `` Ducky . '' ### `` But call her ` Patty , ' and it 's a sure giveaway you 're not in her circle , because she does n't use that name , '' says Joan Kron , editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine , a monthly publication sent to all the right names . ### John Spencer Churchill , a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill , former prime minister of Great Britain , is n't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets . ### That 's because they only drop `` mere names , '' says Mr. Churchill . ### Currently writing his memoirs , Mr. Churchill , an artist , tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty , the oil billionnaire , were , in fact , known only by one initial , their last . ### When you 're at the club , you ask whether they 've spoken to ` G . ' ### Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean . ### But no one else does . ### Now that 's name-dropping , if you know what I mean . ### Part of a Series -RCB- ### SMYRNA , Ga. -- The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway , stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles Atlanta to the `` Big Chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark . ### Twenty years ago , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a handful of dealerships were here . ### Now there are 23 . ### Alongside such long-familiar names as Chevrolet , Ford and Dodge are nameplates that did n't exist until three years ago : Acura , Sterling , Hyundai . ### Under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of Lexus , a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago . ### The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America , in everything from phone companies to colas . ### And especially , as the Cobb Parkway strip attests , in cars . ### Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from just 408 when the decade began , according to Automotive News , a trade publication . ### For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block . ### For American car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing . ### Malcolm MacDougall , vice chairman of the Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . '' ### He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today , and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image . ### `` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . '' ### He says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image . ### He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines . ### Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks . ### `` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp . ### `` But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs '' in choosing one 's wheels . ### Jeanene Page , of North Salt Lake City , Utah , likes the broader selection . ### She wants something big , and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car . ### Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time . ### `` That seems to be what all my friends are using to take the grandkids to the lake , '' she says . ### Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago . ### The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make `` a car for every purse and purpose . '' ### Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose . ### Just four years ago , GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments . ### Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans . ### The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here . ### For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in . ### Detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own . ### GM launched the Geo marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and next year GM 's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut . ### Ford Motor Co. created the Merkur nameplate in 1985 to sell its German-made touring sedans in the U.S . ### But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week . ### When consumers have so many choices , brand loyalty is much harder to maintain . ### The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey found that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands . ### For the survey , Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits . ### Which cars do Americans favor most these days ? ### It 's hard to generalize , but age seems to be the best predictor . ### Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do . ### Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car , compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over , according to the Journal survey . ### Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car . ### Perhaps most striking , 35 % of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car . ### That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older . ### Generally , imports appeal most to Americans who live in the West and are well-educated , affluent and , especially , young . ### `` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says Christopher Cedergren , auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif . ### Such preferences persist even though many Americans believe differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing . ### Only 58 % of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the Journal survey found , down from 68 % in 1987 . ### Some 46 % give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from 50 % two years ago . ### On the other hand , only 42 % say foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models , down from 55 % in 1987 . ### People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger Americans are to brand switching . ### `` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares Thomas Mignanelli , executive vice president for Nissan 's U.S. sales operations . ### But out on Cobb Parkway , Ted Negas sees it differently . ### `` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip . ### Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back , just as it was possible to lose them . ### The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip . ### Ed Voyles Olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars are less than a year old , so they get quicker service . ### Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side . ### Manufacturers , too , are stretching further to lure buyers . ### GM 's Cadillac division , ignoring Detroit 's long-held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features . ### Cadillac may be on to something . ### Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag . ### More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags . ### Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 . ### In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo-charged engines had little appeal . ### But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days . ### GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo-charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model , even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped with that option . ### The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's . ### Americans spent more than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last year , and just 1 % of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion . ### `` Even if it 's only 1 % , '' says GM 's Mr. Barabba , `` would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid ? '' ### American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it will lay off 75 to 85 technicians here , effective Nov. 1 . ### The workers install , maintain and repair its private branch exchanges , which are large intracompany telephone networks . ### It 's a California crime saga worthy of an Erle Stanley Gardner title : The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees . ### Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms , called cycads , once stood . ### Days later , the thieves returned and dug out more , this time adding insult to injury . ### `` The second time , '' he says , `` they left the shovel . '' ### No garden-variety crime , palm-tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California , bringing big bucks to crooks who know their botany . ### Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds . ### Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year , it 's a pricey lawn decoration : A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $ 1,000 , and taller ones often fetch $ 3,000 or more . ### `` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' says Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum . ### Just last week , would-be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock 's home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened them off , foiled . ### `` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says . ### Police suspect that the criminals , who dig up the plants in the dead of night , are selling them to nurseries or landscapers . ### The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts , apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds . ### Thieves are going to find `` anybody who has enough bucks to plant these things in their front yard , '' says William Morrissey , an investigator with the police department in Garden Grove , Calif. , where five such thefts have been reported in the past several weeks . ### The department is advising residents to plant Sagos , if they must , in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off . ### But for those Californians who want exotic gardens out front where neighbors can appreciate them , there 's always Harold Smith 's approach . ### After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove , `` I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain , '' he says proudly . ### And you ca n't cut this chain with bolt cutters . ### Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume . ### September program trading amounted to 13.8 % of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares , the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures public in July 1988 . ### A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever . ### The highest level was in June 1989 , when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies . ### Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September . ### Program trading amounted to 12.3 % of average daily volume in June . ### The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks . ### The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage , in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits . ### It 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market . ### Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September , but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage . ### Overall , Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares . ### The top stock-index arbitrage firm last month was Morgan Stanley & Co . ### Of Morgan Stanley 's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month , 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades . ### Behind second-place Morgan Stanley were Kidder , Peabody & Co. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston Inc. 's First Boston Corp. unit . ### A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , First Executive Corp. and others , charging them with artificially inflating Imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors . ### The complaint , filed in federal district court , accuses Imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data . ### It also charges that Imperial , the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan , experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages . ### The suit seeks unspecified damages . ### Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities . ### The derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year . ### Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems . ### Although an Imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit , he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit . ### Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit . ### In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here , shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial , its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company 's assets . ### Imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either . ### Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . ### The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . ### Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . ### The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . ### Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate . ### Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , said it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group . ### Rhone-Poulenc , a chemical and pharmaceutical company , said RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $ 900 million . ### It did n't release terms of the transaction . ### Consumer spending in Britain rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago , the Central Statistical Office estimated Friday . ### A group including Gene E. Phillips , former chairman of Southmark Corp. , and William S. Friedman , former vice chairman of Southmark , lowered its stake in the Dallas real estate concern to 7.7 % , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . ### The group said it sold 455,410 Southmark common shares from Sept. 5 to Oct. 5 for 18.75 cents to 25 cents a share . ### The filing said the group continues to hold 3,481,887 remaining shares . ### Eastman Kodak Co. , seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market , unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video . ### The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business . ### While the prototype converter is costly , it 's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium . ### `` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming . ### He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs . ### Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition . ### And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development . ### It 's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing . ### Kodak says its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video . ### Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers . ### Otherwise , they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs . ### It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology . ### The new converters are `` a critical link between film and the television domain , '' says Joerg D. Agin , vice president and general manager of Kodak 's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division . ### Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years . ### A similar machine already on the market , made by Rank Sintel Ltd. , a unit of Rank Organisation , costs about $ 500,000 . ### And the potential market is tremendous , industry experts say . ### If HDTV takes off in the U.S. , there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters , known in the industry as telecines . ### Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations . ### `` The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I 've seen , '' says Richard J. Stumpf , vice president-engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios . ### And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision . ### They ca n't afford to stay out of HDTV . '' ### Indeed , the stakes are high . ### The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $ 150 billion over the next two decades , with an additional $ 400 billion expected to go for related products . ### HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail . ### And the sets are wider , resembling the dimensions of a movie screen . ### But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed . ### Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs wo n't be available for another five to 10 years , and will probably retail for more than $ 3,000 each in today 's dollars . ### Some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price . ### Nevertheless , Kodak could n't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur . ### `` Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going , '' says RIT 's Mr. Spaull . ### Yet another political scandal is racking Japan . ### But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members . ### And as it unfolds , it 's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society . ### Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month . ### But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone . ### `` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst . ### But , he adds , `` We ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it . '' ### This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry . ### Pachinko , a kind of pinball , is Japan 's favorite form of legal gambling . ### The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co . influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year . ### But the implications could be great . ### Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders . ### Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions , and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe . ### Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan . ### To many Japanese , pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory . ### Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country . ### Devotees pass hours , watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping , as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous , alone with their thoughts . ### At 500 yen -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II . ### But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen -LRB- almost $ 92 billion -RRB- , or nearly the size of Japan 's vaunted automobile industry . ### And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen . ### If that money were being taxed , it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen . ### In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions . ### Then , in 1988 , a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament . ### The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral . ### In August , a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members . ### The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren . ### The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report . ### And at first , neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue . ### But the press kept it alive ; as with the Recruit scandal , lists began circulating with names of people who had received money . ### Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations . ### So far , though , there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes . ### Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members . ### The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization , and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen . ### On Friday , the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry , including 450,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,175 -RRB- by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu . ### No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal . ### Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations . ### They say possible some of their members may be donating privately . ### The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese . ### That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society . ### Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support . ### Both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad . ### But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally . ### When Robert McDuffie was 14 , he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon , Ga . ### Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending . ### `` I threw such a fit , '' says Mr. McDuffie , who had begun violin studies at the age of six . ### But once Perlman started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball . ### Afterwards , I went home and practiced for three hours . '' ### Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , six-foot , one-inch musician made the right choice . ### At 31 , Mr. McDuffie has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule . ### He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia , with stops including Charleston , S.C . -LRB- Oct. 25 -RRB- , Sarasota , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 28 -RRB- , Tampa , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 29 -RRB- and Miami -LRB- Oct. 31 -RRB- . ### Later this season he gives a recital at Washington 's Kennedy Center , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras . ### Yet Mr. McDuffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries . ### During the late 1970s , he was part of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay . ### His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition . ### `` I thought I was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls Mr. McDuffie , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl . ### But I was n't ready for a career at that time . '' ### Young McDuffie 's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger , a Hungarian refugee who taught in the Macon public school system . ### `` He taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician . ### I did n't learn to count until I got to Juilliard . '' ### After studies at that conservatory 's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian , he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay , Mr. Galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival . ### `` I think I had to prove myself to her , '' says Mr. McDuffie . ### But she was always encouraging . ### She only put her foot down twice , '' he continues . ### In my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal . ### She thought I was n't getting my practicing done . '' ### As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' '' ### The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself . ### Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital . ### `` We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ? ### That 's the only note that 's truly in tune . . . ' . '' ### `` That 's the most important experience I 've had with any teacher , '' he says , `` because she taught me how to listen . ### Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . '' ### It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber . ### After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` Violin Concerto , '' Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer . ### `` Barber was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment . ### He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score . ### There 's a beautiful , Coplandesque motif -- he 'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement . ### The only time the violin has it is right at the end . ### It 's written ` marcato ' in the score , and I played it that way , kind of gigue-like . ### And he yelled out ` dolce dolce ' -LCB- ` sweet sweet ' -RCB- . '' ### `` So we did it over , '' he adds . ### I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow . ### If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra -LCB- volume -RCB- at that point , it makes the piece magical . ### I do n't know why Barber never told anybody else . ### On Isaac Stern 's recording it 's very biting . '' ### Since leaving Juilliard , Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones . ### His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera `` Another World , '' scandalized musical elitists . ### By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which he recently recorded for along with Leonard Bernstein 's engaging `` Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion . '' ### Mr. McDuffie 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works . ### Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings . ### Mr. Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente . '' ### But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani . ### At Avery Fisher Hall here , Mr. McDuffie was heard recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- Bruch 's overwrought `` Violin Concerto in G Minor . '' ### His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed . ### The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big , lush sound that belied its size . ### Whatever he plays , Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife , Camille , a literary publicist . ### `` A normal person did not write the Beethoven ` Violin Concerto , ' '' he declares . ### Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece . ### If I could ever feel I 've contributed to it in some way , then all the hard work has been worth it . '' ### Ms. Jepson is a free-lance music writer in New York . ### Are consumers too deep in hock ? ### A lot of observers think so , and , if they 're right , the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt . ### A sudden , forced cutback by consumers , who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity , would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments ca n't readily take up the slack . ### And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions . ### The worriers cite some worrisome trends . ### During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion , inflation-adjusted gross national product , disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30 % , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66 % . ### And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income -- personal income after taxes -- has hit a high of about 18 % . ### However , these figures do n't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin , an economist at the Federal Reserve Board . ### In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco , Mr. Durkin comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences . '' ### He adds : `` We are now witnessing a slowdown which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while . '' ### But what about the debt burden ? ### Mr. Durkin doubts that `` there is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems . '' ### And , `` more importantly , '' he says , `` the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters . '' ### The chart below shows why -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 -RRB- . ### The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income , though up a bit , has n't climbed steeply , and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed . ### Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. Durkin says . ### He notes that some `` revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit '' being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing . ### In addition , he says , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . '' ### And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' Mr. Durkin says , `` much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families , '' that is , `` those probably best able to handle it . '' ### Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . '' ### And much home-equity credit is used conservatively . ### `` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' Mr. Durkin says . ### So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 -RRB- . ### A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat . ### In fact , the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers , conservative as ever , are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly . ### In July , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987 . ### `` Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending , '' Bruce Steinberg , a Merrill Lynch economist , says . ### As a result , household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63 % of GNP . '' ### Consumers , credit cards in hand , are n't running amok through the shopping malls -- or putting the economy at any great risk . ### Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public . ### The 67-year-old maker of brassieres , panties , and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images , but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family . ### `` There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group , '' says Robert A. Brawer , 52 years old , recently named president , succeeding Beatrice Coleman , his mother-in-law , who remains chairman . ### `` We are a vanishing breed , '' he muses . ### Mrs. Coleman , 73 , who declined to be interviewed , is the Maidenform strategist . ### Sales have tripled during her 21-year tenure to about $ 200 million in 1988 . ### Maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics . ### The company sells image . ### Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons . ### The Maidenform name `` is part of American pop culture , '' says Joan Sinopoli , account supervisor of the campaign by Levine , Huntley , Schmidt & Beaver , a New York ad firm . ### Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman . You never know where she 'll turn up . '' ### `` Capitalizing on the brand is key , '' says Mr. Brawer , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S . ### `` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- Maidenform -RCB- is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York . ### Although working women are `` forced to wear the uniform of the day , to retain their femininity they are buying better quality , more upscale intimate apparel , '' he said . ### Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising . ### Three days later , Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co. , a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc . ### Warnaco also owns Warners , another major intimate apparel maker . ### Mr. Lesk could n't be reached to comment . ### But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job . ### `` If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for , '' says James Mogan , 45 , who was named senior vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk . ### The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people . ### `` My style is less informal , '' Mr. Brawer says . ### Top officers insist Maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership . ### `` You ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart , '' one delights . ### `` It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. Brawer says . ### You can think long range . '' ### Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way . ### Warnaco was taken private by Spectrum Group in 1986 for about $ 487 million . ### And last year , Playtex Holdings Inc. went private for about $ 680 million . ### It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc. , the intimate apparel division , and Playtex Family Products Corp. , which makes tampons , hair-care items and other products . ### Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel . ### Buy-out offers for Maidenform are n't infrequent , says Executive Vice President David C. Masket , but they are n't taken very seriously . ### When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman , Mr. Masket says . ### The company could command a good price in the market . ### `` Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales , '' says Deborah Bronston , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst . ### Mr. Brawer , along with Mrs. Coleman and her daughter , Elizabeth , an attorney who is vice chairman , are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform , which employs about 5,000 . ### Mr. Brawer 's wife , Catherine , and Robert Stroup , Elizabeth 's husband , round out the five-member board . ### Each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings . ### `` We are all very amiable , '' Mr. Brawer says . ### Executives say Mrs. Coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations , especially product development . ### In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales . ### Her father , William Rosenthal , designed the then-dress making company 's first bra in the 1920s , which he said gave women a `` maiden form '' compared with the `` boyish form '' they got from the `` flat bandages '' used for support at the time . ### While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , Ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters . ### The name Maidenform was coined by a third business partner , Enid Bissett . ### The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S. , Puerto Rico , other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland . ### Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores , but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in Omaha , Neb. , and has 24 factory outlets , with plans to add more . ### Before joining Maidenform in 1972 , Mr. Brawer , who holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago , taught at the University of Wisconsin . ### As a senior vice president , he has headed the company 's designer lingerie division , Oscar de la Renta , since its inception in 1988 . ### To maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the Maidenform name . ### While the company has always been family-run , Mr. Brawer is n't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform . ### Mrs. Coleman 's husband , Joseph , a physician , succeeded Mrs. Rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 . ### China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year , a Western government report says , unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit . ### According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 . ### A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports . ### The $ 14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much . ### The report by the Western government , which declines to be identified , concludes that `` a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below 5 % per annum . '' ### According to Chinese customs figures , import growth has slowed in recent months , dropping to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August from the year-earlier periods , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half . ### But before import growth slowed , China 's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves . ### The $ 14 billion level in June marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of April . ### China 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ 10.6 billion in June 1985 from $ 16.6 billion the previous September . ### China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline , when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency . ### But this time , China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4 . ### For example , China 's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4 . ### Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $ 1.3 billion , down from $ 2.2 billion last year . ### Because of this and the huge trade gap , the deficit in China 's current account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is expected to widen sharply from the $ 3.8 billion deficit last year . ### The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China 's current-account balance , two of which are considered most likely . ### In one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25 % and 5 % recorded during the first seven months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion . ### In 1985 , China had a record deficit of $ 11.4 billion . ### The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months . ### In this case , China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $ 8.7 billion , based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20 % and exports 10 % . ### If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders , it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit . ### But since June , foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China . ### Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before . ### In addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China 's deteriorating political and economic environment . ### On top of all this , foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992 . ### With less capital coming in , China 's balance of payments would suffer . ### The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment . ### In the second , foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10 % and investment to drop 10 % . ### But in either case , the report says , China 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves , which are used to finance the imbalance . ### In the first scenario , the reserves would be exhausted next year , and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991 . ### Roche Holding AG , parent of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said its group sales rose 22 % in the first nine months of the year to 7.32 billion francs -LRB- $ 4.51 billion -RRB- . ### The company reported good gains in all of its divisions . ### Roche also said it expects a `` considerable rise '' in 1989 group profit from the 641.5 million-franc -LRB- $ 396 million -RRB- net in 1988 . ### New Canaan Investments Inc. said it closed the acquisition of Carr-Lowrey Glass Co. from Newell Co. , a Freeport , Ill. , maker of do-it-yourself home products . ### Terms were n't disclosed . ### Carr-Lowrey , a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and toiletries industries , had sales last year of about $ 40 million . ### New Canaan Investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry . ### Ralph Brown was 31,000 feet over Minnesota when both jets on his Falcon 20 flamed out . ### At 18,000 feet , he says , he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land . ### At 13,000 feet , the engines restarted . ### But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time . ### Had he been a little less gung-ho , `` I 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar , '' Mr. Brown says . ### But he flies for Federal Express Corp. , perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets . ### Federal 's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock . ### Like Mr. Brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time . ### They are a tribute to Federal 's management which , since the company 's founding 16 years ago , has had its way with its work force -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry . ### That may soon change . ### This month , Federal 's 2,048 pilots , including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February , will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent . ### The election , which would bring the first major union to Federal 's U.S. operations , has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown . ### It has also rattled Federal 's strongly anti-union management , which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits . ### `` A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory , '' Frederick W. Smith , Federal 's chairman and chief executive , says with disdain . ### In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition . '' ### What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots . ### Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's job classifications into Federal 's . ### Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers . ### These groups constitute up to 10 % of its work force . ### `` Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company , '' says Bernard La Londe , a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant . ### That culture , carefully crafted by Mr. Smith , leaves little , if any , room for unions . ### Since founding the company , the charismatic Vietnam vet , who is still only 46 years old , has fostered an ethos of combat . ### Flights are `` missions . '' ### Mr. Smith 's managers have , at times , been called `` Ho Chi Minh 's Guerrillas . '' ### The Bravo Zulu award , the Navy accolade for a `` job well done , '' is bestowed on Federal 's workers who surpass the call of duty . ### Competitors are known as the `` enemy . '' ### To reinforce employees ' dedication , Mr. Smith pays well . ### He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats . ### He gives pep talks in periodic `` family briefings '' beamed internationally on `` FXTV , '' the company 's own television network . ### And , with many of his 70,000 workers , Mr. Smith 's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on . ### James Cleveland , a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer 's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m. , considers himself far more than a courier . ### We do n't just hand the customer the package . ### That 's just the beginning , '' he says . ### In essence , we run the show . '' ### David Sanders , a longtime pilot , bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule . ### `` This is America , '' he says . ### Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work . '' ### Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean . ### The company deliberately understaffs , stretching employees ' schedules to the limit . ### But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush , they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck . ### Pilots , as well , routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows . ### The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc. , the nation 's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members . ### UPS wo n't discuss its labor practices , but , according to Mr. Cleveland , a former UPS employee , and others , union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans . ### Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot , say these couriers , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late . ### Labor problems are the last thing Mr. Smith needs right now . ### Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems . ### It more than doubled Federal 's long-term debt to $ 1.9 billion , thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four . ### Federal , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas . ### It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes . ### On routes to South America , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded . ### In Europe , business suffered as Federal bought several local companies , only to have the managers quit . ### These and other problems squeezed Federal 's profit margins last year to 8 % , down from more than 13 % annually in the first half of the decade . ### Earnings have plummeted , too , in each of the past three quarters . ### In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says . ### Federal 's stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks , analysts say . ### Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . ### They closed Friday at $ 53.25 , down 50 cents on the day . ### There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase . ### Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies `` over the Hump '' from India to China during World War II . ### In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations . ### But from early on , Tiger 's workers unionized , while Federal 's never have . ### Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually . ### Analysts expect Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 , when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger 's extra flights , back-up planes and landing rights . ### Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits . ### For now , the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal 's Tiger problems , management believes . ### Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination . ### When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority . ### He then made most of the changes , pilots say . ### That sort of approach , however , has n't worked since the addition of Tiger . ### Its 6,500 workers , who had battled Tiger 's management for years over givebacks , were union members until the day of the merger , when most of their unions were automatically decertified . ### Soon after the merger , moreover , Federal 's management asked Tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time , without cause or notice . ### When the pilots refused , the company retracted it . ### Mr. Smith angered Federal 's pilots , too . ### In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options . ### The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure . ### Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger . ### And even some pro-union pilots say his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat . ### `` A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith , '' says J.X. Gollich , a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist . ### Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles , Ohio , New York , Alaska , Asia and Europe . ### Recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments . ### In one video , Mr. Smith defended his agreement to merge the pilot-seniority lists . ### He said Mr. Steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly . ### Regulators , as well , might have quashed the deal if Tiger 's pilots had n't been protected , he said . ### Furthermore , Mr. Smith added , `` our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice . ### It does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change . '' ### Already , the fight has been costly . ### The seniority-list controversy , along with the job-classification dispute , has been turned over to the mediator . ### Meanwhile , the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists , and that is costing Federal `` a big number , '' says James Barksdale , executive vice president and chief operating officer . ### The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots . ### `` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran . ### Adds John Poag , a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board : `` They 've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots , and for us , nothing . '' ### Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote . ### A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union , according to a union study . ### But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed , it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded . ### The fight has turned ugly and , among pilots at least , has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build . ### Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties . ### Some younger pilots say they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country . ### And for now , at least , the competition is n't the only enemy . ### Barney Barnhardt , a 727 captain and leader of the pro-union forces , said he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague . ### `` The pilots are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh . ### Harsco Corp. said it obtained a $ 33.1 million export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment . ### Harsco declined to say what country placed the order . ### The company said it received an order for 23 of the vehicles , which retrieve tanks and other heavy-tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged , and an option for 16 more . ### Delivery is to begin in early 1991 . ### Harsco produces products for defense , industrial , commercial and construction markets . ### The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job . ### Mr. Hastings 's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . ### In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him . ### He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial . ### With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed . ### Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove Judge Hastings from office . ### He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation . ### The Senate did n't vote on six lesser charges . ### Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury , lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual . ### Instead , they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust , irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases . ### Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber . ### In an impromptu news conference on the Capitol steps , he denounced the senators ' action . ### `` Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' Mr. Hastings said . ### For the future , he said he would run for governor of Florida . ### Mr. Hastings was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country . ### While he packed the Senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial , most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case . ### Following the impeachment conviction , Dr. Benjamin Hooks , executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , issued a restrained statement , warning that the Hastings case could set a `` dangerous precedent , '' but adding , `` We must respect the considered judgment of the Senate . ### When last we left him , FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery , unraveled a Washington political scandal , and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries `` Favorite Son . '' ### What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold ? ### A spinoff series , of course . ### There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup : a nun raising some lovable orphans . ### A den mother raising some lovable teen models . ### A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards . ### In that context , Robert Loggia 's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most . ### Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' -LRB- NBC , Fridays , 10 p.m . ET -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI . ### Over the first few weeks , `` Mancuso FBI '' has sprung straight from the headlines , which is either a commendable stab at topicality , or a lack of imagination , or both . ### The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -LRB- a la John Tower -RRB- . ### When his secretary is found floating dead in the pol 's pool , Mancuso is called in to investigate . ### Last week , a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer -LRB- a la Tawana Brawley -RRB- . ### In this week 's show , there 's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility -LRB- a la Rocky Flats -RRB- . ### Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -LRB- Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young boss -LRB- Fredric Lehne -RRB- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB- Lindsay Frost -RRB- , and a forensics expert -LRB- Charles Siebert -RRB- . ### If all of this seems a little stale , it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists : The usual suspects are found to be guilty , then not guilty , then guilty -- but of a different crime . ### In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -RRB- ### Most of all though , the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso . ### What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s . ### He was n't protecting the Freedom Marchers ; he was tailing them as subversives . ### This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario that thrills his young colleagues : `` Kid , you 've been reading Classic Comics too long , '' Mancuso says . ### Back in 1964 , the FBI had five black agents . ### Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover , and two cleaned his house . '' ### At the core of Mr. Loggia 's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence . ### He describes a reporter as `` Miss First Amendment . '' ### He describes a drowned corpse as `` Esther Williams . '' ### And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine . '' ### Yet for all his cynicism , he 's at heart a closet idealist , a softy with a secret crush on truth , justice and the American Way . ### He 's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags . ### If `` Mancuso FBI '' has an intriguing central character , it also has a major flaw : It 's wildly overwritten . ### Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner -LRB- and Ken Solarz and Steve Bello -RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point . ### To start , there 's always a crisis -- and someone always worries , `` What if the press gets a hold of this ? '' ### At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans . ### At least once Mancuso 's boss yells `` In here -- now , '' and proceeds to dress his investigator down : `` You are a dinosaur... a hangover in a $ 10 suit . ### One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . '' ### Finally , of course , the boss gives in , but he 's still yelling : `` I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy , you 'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage . '' ### In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches . ### Witnesses shout , scream , pontificate : ``... a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who try to tear down every decent man who raises his voice . '' ### And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician . ### You twist people 's trust . ### You built your career on prejudice and hate . ### The scars will be here years after the polls close . '' ### In each show , Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues : `` Where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ? ### You 're the real criminal here... and what you did was n't just a murder -- it was a crime against humanity . '' ### And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox . '' ### Now that 's advice the writers should take to heart . ### They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it . ### Why , when a key witness disappears , does Mancuso trash her apartment , tearing down drapes , smashing walls ? ### It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz . ### That 's not plot . ### That 's not character . ### That 's hyperventilating . ### There is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David . ### Asked to say a few words , he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk , but he 's too choked up to get the words out . ### He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away . ### It was a profoundly moving moment for series television , and Robert Loggia 's acting resonated in the silence . ### There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` Mancuso FBI . '' ### If the show 's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little , they might just hear it . ### With a Twist of the Wrist Boys with tops , and Frisbee tossers , And P.R. types with bees in their bonnet , Have a goal in common , all of them try To put the right spin on it . ### -- George O. Ludcke . ### Investment letters now abound , I really like to read them ; If I peruse enough , I 've found I 've no time left to heed them ### -- Bern Sharfman . ### TV evangelist : salesparson . ### -- Marguerite Whitley May . ### Texaco Inc. has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $ 476.5 million , its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with Pennzoil Co. began more than four years ago . ### The White Plains , N.Y. , oil company said Friday that it had acquired Tana Production Corp. , a subsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings Inc. , for $ 95.1 million in cash , with the rest to be paid in shares of a new , non-voting issue of preferred stock . ### Tana , which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south Texas , will provide Texaco with mostly gas reserves . ### The fields contain recoverable reserves of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil . ### `` This acquisition is another indication of Texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base , '' said Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear . ### Texaco has also been attempting to sell oil properties . ### At least two years ago , the company put 60 million barrels of oil reserves on the block . ### They were either too small or uneconomic to maintain , the company said . ### Not all of those parcels have yet been sold . ### Texaco acquired Tana before it completed those sales because Tana 's properties are high quality and near other fields Texaco already owns , a company spokeswoman said . ### Texaco , like many other oil companies , has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves . ### Texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its brawl with Pennzoil and then on New York investor Carl C. Icahn 's attempt to take over the company . ### Pennzoil had sued Texaco for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of Getty Oil Co . ### Eventually , Texaco , which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation , settled its fight with Pennzoil for $ 3 billion in 1986 . ### Mr. Icahn , who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company , sold his stake in Texaco just last summer . ### Completion of Texaco 's acquisition of Tana is subject to government approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act . ### CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 . ### The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs , said Jay R. Cohen , Champs executive vice president . ### CRI , which sponsors Champs , is a world-wide real estate investment firm . ### H&R BLOCK Inc. had net income of $ 100.2 million , or $ 1.90 a share , in the fiscal year ended April 30 . ### The figure was incorrectly shown as a net loss in a chart accompanying Friday 's Heard on the Street column . ### Your Oct. 2 article on Daniel Yankelovich cited the quote `` A good name is better than great riches '' as being from Cervantes ' `` Don Quixote . '' ### Actually , Cervantes borrowed that quote from a writer of some 25 centuries earlier : Israel 's King Solomon wrote those words in the Book of Proverbs -LRB- 22:1 -RRB- . ### Michael E. Hill ### Japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $ 1.82 billion for the first 10 days of October , down from $ 3.16 billion a year earlier , the Finance Ministry said . ### The latest drop shows the narrowing in the nation 's trade gap reflected in successive full monthly reports is continuing . ### The report follows five-consecutive declines in full monthly figures . ### Imports rose sharply in the period , to $ 5.19 billion from $ 4.04 billion a year earlier , a change of 28 % . ### Exports during the period were $ 7.01 billion , 2.6 % below $ 7.20 billion a year ago . ### Groupe AG 's chairman said the Belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider . ### Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock . ### Since the beginning of the year , the stock has nearly doubled , giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs -LRB- $ 2.7 billion -RRB- . ### The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie . Financiere de Suez , the acquisitive French financial conglomerate . ### But Mr. Lippens said a rescue also could involve Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. , which owns 5 % of AG . ### AG is hardly alone in its anxiety . ### A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping Europe 's once-stately insurance business . ### Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars . ### In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks . ### In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle . ### Mr. Lippens said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-September . ### But he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months . ### Aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions , Mr. Lippens has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them , Axa-Midi , Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez , all based in France . ### They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG , '' he said . ### Any raider would find it hard to crack AG 's battlements . ### A `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares . ### Aside from Generale de Belgique and Asahi , the syndicate includes Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas , a Belgian savings bank , and various family interests . ### A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control . ### Asahi officials could n't be reached for comment . ### Even without bid talk , this year 's surge in prices for Brussels real estate has excited interest in AG . ### The company says those holdings constitute the third-biggest real-estate portfolio in Belgium . ### With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ? ### President Bush 's national security adviser , Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft , came into office in January intent on making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration . ### Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran-Contra affair . ### He was all too aware of how a large , inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan 's second term . ### So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out . ### The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be `` small '' and warned against letting `` energetic self-starters '' like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department , Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency . ### However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues . ### During the coup attempt and its aftermath , NSC staffers were `` stretched very thin , '' says one senior administration official . ### `` It 's a very small shop . '' ### Gen. Scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now , but is weighing that possibility , the official adds . ### The NSC staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think-tank . ### The problem with this administration , I think , is that by design it has greatly diminished , both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense , the role of the NSC . '' ### The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies . ### By law , the council includes the president , vice president and secretaries of state and defense . ### In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members . ### But the size , shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide . ### That task is one of Washington 's perennial problems . ### In the Bush White House , the size of the NSC 's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration officials say . ### Administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the Panama crisis . ### But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America , Everett Briggs , was gone . ### He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration 's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua 's Contra rebels . ### The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff . ### Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates , are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs . ### Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society . ### Both have become confidants of President Bush . ### But neither has an extensive background in Latin America , the Middle East or Asia . ### In those areas , the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important . ### Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus . ### But just as every previous NSC adviser has , Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained . ### Japan 's wholesale prices in the first 10 days of October fell 0.3 % from the previous 10 days but rose 3.3 % from a year ago , the Bank of Japan said . ### The wholesale price index stood at 89.6 -LRB- 1985 equals 100 -RRB- . ### A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive , admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s . ### Frank Lavelle , who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater , Fla. , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin , the Navy official . ### Mr. Tomlin , who left the Navy in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges . ### The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria , Va . ### Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986 . ### Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment . ### Mr. Tomlin , among other things , illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said . ### Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work . ### Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained `` approval of the scheme '' from more-senior Sperry officials `` because the payment which -LCB- Mr . -RCB- Tomlin requested was so large . '' ### Charles Gardner , a former Unisys vice president , and James Neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes . ### Unisys has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company . ### Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine . ### The New York Stock Exchange said a seat was sold for $ 500,000 , unchanged from the sale Thursday . ### Seats are quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked . ### Bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation , after all . ### Matthew Lesko , something of a professional defender of government , thought he had a sure-fire winner last summer when he offered $ 5,000 for the best `` verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you . '' ### He sent out thousands of news releases from his Kensington , Md. , office . ### He plugged the contest on Larry King 's radio show , on Pat Sajak 's television show and on the C-SPAN cable television network . ### He talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how-to advice on using government information for fun and profit . ### Mr. Lesko figured he would be flooded with entries by now . ### After all , he says , `` we 've got like 15 million bureaucrats . '' ### And in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` My Favorite Bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners-up $ 500 . ### So far , though , Mr. Lesko has received only one entry . ### To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss . ### Mr. Lesko , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats . ### But he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank-and-file folks . ### He admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest . ### Newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases . ### Talk show hosts quickly change the topic . ### But Mr. Lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest . ### `` Is the government not helping anybody ? '' asks Toni Murray , an assistant to Mr. Lesko . ### Mr. Lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation . ### `` People hate to write , '' he says . ### `` Maybe people do n't believe I want to give this money away . '' ### Maybe Americans are just so annoyed with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while . ### If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , Mr. Lesko admits , `` I 'd get 5,000 entries . '' ### Now there 's an idea . ### Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return . ### With the collapse of the talks Friday , European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC , which is scrambling to fend off a hostile Ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with Ford 's archrival , General Motors Corp . ### Saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business . ### Saab said last week it `` has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . '' ### Among the possible suitors is Italy 's Fiat S.p . A , analysts said last week . ### Ford and Saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both parties . '' ### Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology . ### Ford originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U.S. luxury car markets . ### In addition , Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations . ### But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far . ### Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab 's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy . ### Meanwhile , Ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make Saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market . ### Saab 's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor -LRB- $ 186.1 million -RRB- loss during the first eight months of this year , slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month . ### Overall , Saab-Scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9 % to 1 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 155.1 million -RRB- from 1.96 billion kronor -LRB- $ 303.9 million -RRB- a year earlier . ### Industry analysts in Europe said the most likely suitor for Saab now is Fiat . ### Saab and Fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab 's 9000 model , Fiat 's Croma and Lancia 's Thema . ### Last month , Saab-Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund said his company has had talks with Fiat about a broader alliance . ### But the talks yielded `` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , '' he said . ### As for Ford , analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with GM for a stake in Jaguar . ### The failure of the Saab talks `` makes it even more crucial for -LCB- Ford -RCB- to be victorious '' in the Jaguar contest , said Stephen Reitman , European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew in London . ### Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar , however . ### Jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month . ### GM , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker 's headquarter operations in Detroit . ### A GM spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the Jaguar situation . ### But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S . ### Last week , Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name . ### So despite the GM-Jaguar romance , analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11 % of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from 10.4 % early last week . ### About 5.4 million Jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on London 's stock exchange Friday , and Jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- . ### On the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $ 11.125 . ### Joann S. Lublin contributed to this article . ### The Dallas Cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the Atlanta Falcons . ### Up in his stadium box , their new and controversial owner , Jerral `` Jerry '' Jones , watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line . ### Mr. Jones takes heart . ### There in the center of the pack is quarterback Troy Aikman , the key to the Cowboys ' comeback strategy . ### So key , in fact , that Mr. Jones signed him in April for $ 11.4 million over the next six years -- a record for a rookie . ### `` He 's a genuine Wheaties-box athlete , '' gushes Mr. Jones . ### With three minutes left on the clock , Mr. Aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back . ### The crowd groans , Mr. Jones shakes his head , the Cowboys lose the game . ### A few days after that Sept. 17 game , Mr. Aikman broke a finger , sidelining him for weeks . ### Ah , the glamour of professional sports . ### For Mr. Jones , losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys -- and , this year , much of the National Football League . ### Once fat and happy , the Cowboys now are losing games , fans and money . ### Last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue . ### It has some of the highest costs in the league . ### Its attendance is off 23 % from six years ago . ### At the very least , Mr. Jones , who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench , can take comfort in one fact : These days , he is n't alone . ### Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr. Aikman . ### Last year , the top 12 players on each NFL team took home an average $ 536,000 , a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball . ### First-round draft picks have done even better : Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987 . ### `` It 's a vicious circle , '' says Art Modell , owner of the Cleveland Browns . ### `` One team pays so much and the other pays more . ### We just do n't have that kind of income stream . '' ### All this is causing convulsions in professional football . ### Owners , largely complacent in the past , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue -- embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process . ### Though not intentionally , the Cowboys ' Mr. Jones has come to represent this new breed of owner . ### Shortly after buying 66 % of the team from H.R. `` Bum '' Bright for $ 145 million , and mindful of the Cowboys ' ragged bottom line , the 47-year-old Mr. Jones set about his own round of team cuts . ### First , he unceremoniously sacked Tom Landry , the legendary coach who took the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons . ### In Dallas , Mr. Landry has a standing just shy of sainthood . ### Anti-Jones sentiment flooded the local press : `` A crude obnoxious hick , '' said one writer ; `` a real oink , '' said another ; `` Who in the hell does he think he is ? '' wrote a third . ### For Mr. Jones , it was just the beginning . ### He quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and , in July , announced plans to sell Valley Ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL . ### Mr. Jones calls the ranch `` the Pentagon of Sportdom . '' ### It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era . ### He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help . ### `` I said , ` Somebody come get me . ### I 'm at extension 29 . ' '' ### With a new day dawning on the sport , Mr. Jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury . ### `` It 's just not cost efficient , '' he says . ### The place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain . ### When he sells it , he says , the Cowboys will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice field near Texas Stadium . ### And as for Tom Landry , well , in Mr. Jones 's mind , he had played out his winning years . ### After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years , the Cowboys needed a change , he says . ### Football has long been Mr. Jones 's passion , both on and off the field . ### An Arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship . ### After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers . ### Years later , with cash from the sale of the insurance company , he founded Arkoma Production Corp. , an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock . ### So it was n't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry . ### He tapped Jimmy Johnson , a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami , where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987 . ### Whatever Mr. Johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans , he is no Tom Landry . ### Seven games -LRB- and , after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday , seven losses -RRB- into the season , the `` new '' Cowboys are n't doing any better than the old . ### In fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season . ### Average attendance at their games , about 49,000 last year , continues flat . ### Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts . ### He continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks . ### To try to draw more fans , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19 . ### But the general trend , given rising costs in the league , has been to raise prices , and Mr. Jones is expected to eventually follow suit . ### `` It 's simple , '' says Lamar Hunt , who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ 2.40 to an average $ 17 . ### If we did n't increase prices , we 'd be in the red . '' ### Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium -LRB- his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium -RRB- . ### The suites are air-conditioned , have wet bars and plush seating , and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $ 475,000 to $ 1 million , depending on their size and location . ### Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players , and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time . ### The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team , only six of the suites had been sold . ### Today , 30 have . ### Gate receipts are only the Cowboys ' second largest source of cash . ### The biggest is the NFL 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games . ### Last year , the Cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ 17.6 million . ### The team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights . ### Mr. Jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights . ### He is also trying to get more stations in Mexico , where the Cowboys have a following , to pick up the games . ### Mr. Jones , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16-hour days , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days . ### He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his part in the bidding wars . ### Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract , Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $ 4.1 million over the next four years . ### This wage inflation is bleeding the NFL dry , the owners contend . ### Soon , only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams , predicts John J. Veatch Jr. , an investment banker with Salomon Brothers who handled the Cowboys sale . ### To tackle the problem , NFL owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries . ### Details of the plan , which would go into effect in 1993 , are sketchy , but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability . ### Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance . ### The NFL Players Association , meanwhile , contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans , and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management , not players ' salaries . ### The owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too . ### Many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts . ### Most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old . ### In Chicago , for example , size is the issue . ### `` We have the worst lease in the NFL , '' contends Michael B. McCaskey , the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas , who founded the NFL 's predecessor organization . ### `` We 're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated . '' ### When the lease expires in 1999 , he says , `` It 's got to be changed . '' ### This year , the NFL also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp , down from 120 , in a move meant to trim payroll costs . ### And the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract , which expires after this season . ### The current contract pays the NFL $ 1.4 billion . ### Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 % increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings . ### An NFL spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like ESPN . ### The changes have n't come easy . ### Like the game of professional football , the NFL organization itself is in turmoil . ### The new breed of team owner , Mr. Jones included , has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock . ### In July , 11 NFL owners , almost all of them new , blocked an effort to install Jim Finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle . ### Mr. Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the Old Guard . ### Earlier this month , another effort to choose a commissioner failed . ### The owners meet again tomorrow . ### For his part , Jerry Jones says he 's in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that . ### He puts in busy six-day weeks -LRB- excluding game days -RRB- , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a TV producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters . ### To keep his schedule on track , he flies two personal secretaries in from Little Rock to augment his staff in Dallas . ### `` When I made this investment , I made it on a lifetime basis , '' he explains . ### `` I 'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on . ### While the Cowboys may not be the best investment now , I do n't accept they ca n't be in the future . '' ### Besides , to a large extent , Mr. Jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team , even though it keeps losing . ### Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in Arkansas just did n't provide . ### There is the new private jet , the platoon of assistants , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as `` Prime Time Live . '' ### A few weeks ago , Mr. Jones even entertained Elizabeth Taylor in his private suite at Texas Stadium . ### `` You 're in the catbird seat every day in this job , '' he says . ### How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` Days of Rage '' in his television critique -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept 11 -RRB- . ### He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as `` intellectually slipshod . '' ### Was not the title very clear ? ### One example he gives : `` She did n't ask '' -LRB- why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones -RRB- . ### Really now , did she have to ask ? ### Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ? ### Mr. Goldberg contends that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents only one view . ### Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the Israelis feel put upon . ### But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant . ### It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are . ### This film did emphasize how long the stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done . ### Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning . ### Every issue is multisided . ### This film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media . ### Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only . ### Charlotte Carpenter Bainbridge Island , Wash . ### President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week . ### Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict . ### If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts . ### That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has . ### `` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , Tenn . -RRB- of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request . ### `` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said . ### The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money . ### A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts . ### Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget . ### That would give agencies `` less ability... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters . ### Under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled . ### Lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit-cutting measure has been signed into law . ### Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp. , of Clintonville , Wis. , the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state . ### Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed . ### Urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin . ### Since June , Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other Wisconsin firms . ### A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary . ### The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee . ### Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies . ### However , he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans . ### The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions . ### Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans . ### But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted . ### In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee , First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate . ### First Boston , whose holding company , CS First Boston Group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street , said it is also concerned that once the SEC has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities . ### `` The proposal , while well-intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' Michael Raoul-Duval , managing director of First Boston , said in an interview . ### The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said . ### Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible . ### An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . '' ### Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC 's goals . '' ### Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said . ### This letter was inspired by David Asman 's Sept. 25 editorial-page article about Fidel Castro , `` Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking . '' ### I 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists . ### In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government . ### Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort . ### There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban people . ### Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate . ### Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc . ### In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art idealism and revolution seem modest . ### It is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. Asman 's opinions of their country . ### The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba . ### However , unacceptable though those occurrences may have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth . ### Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people . ### They are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances . ### It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -LRB- as we well know -RRB- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy . ### Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials , even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime , such as facilitating defections . ### I think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel does n't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory . ### We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom . ### Without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years . ### From my own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel , we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these days . ### There is no rational justification for such behavior . ### Rachel Weiss Brookline , Mass . ### ENGRAPH INC. recently reported third-quarter earnings , which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates . ### Zacks Investment Research did n't adjust one analyst 's estimate for a stock split , which therefore was artificially high . ### Engraph 's third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7 % higher than the adjusted average of estimates . ### Investors bailed out of New York City bonds in droves last week , driving prices lower and boosting yields . ### One bond trader estimated that more than $ 50 million of New York City general obligation bonds were put up for sale Friday alone . ### While that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding , Friday 's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors . ### `` I 've never seen so many -LCB- New York City -RCB- G.O. 's up for sale , '' said another trader . ### `` Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . '' ### Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty . ### A spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before the November mayoral election . ### General obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit . -RRB- ### Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold . ### The fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that New York 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected . ### New York , one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds , sold $ 750 million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago . ### There have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening , as the October 1987 stock market crash continues to make itself felt . ### The recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns . ### Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding . ### Rumors persisted last week that New York 's credit ratings -- single-A from Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus from Standard & Poor 's Corp. -- are at risk . ### The weakness in New York City bonds follows a warning from New York state Comptroller Edward Regan that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city 's economy . ### In a study , the comptroller said , `` The city 's glory days are over . '' ### Mr. Regan warned mayoral candidates `` to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the New York City economy . '' ### New York City 's revised financial plan , due out later this month , is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ 27 billion budget . ### At present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ 500 million to $ 600 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit . ### Mark Page , New York 's deputy director of finance , said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are `` unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves . '' ### He charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . '' ### There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis . ### The leading contender for the mayoral office , Democrat David Dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs . ### And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election . ### Until last week , Mr. Dinkins was considered a shoo-in . ### `` The market can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people wild , '' said Bernard B. Beal , chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market . ### Until last week , `` Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election . ### Now , there have been a number of questions raised . '' ### Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point . ### New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday . ### As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose , the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week ended Oct. 19 . ### Qintex Australia Ltd. encountered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . ### Qintex Entertainment also said David Evans , its president and chief executive , and Roger Kimmel , a director , both resigned . ### Neither could be reached for comment . ### Earlier this month , Qintex Australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction . ### Mr. Evans had been the de facto head of for months . ### Qintex Entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of `` The New Leave It to Beaver Show . '' ### Qintex Entertainment is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and said it relies on the Australian company for funding its working capital requirements . ### After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , Qintex Entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares . ### The stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer . ### Jonathan Lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment , said Qintex Entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with MCA . ### The $ 5.9 million payment was due Oct. 1 and the deadline for default was Oct. 19 . ### Mr. Lloyd said if Qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements . ### MCA on Friday said that as a result of Qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on `` The New Leave It to Beaver '' as well as other MCA properties . ### Qintex Australia was `` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation . ### They continued to represent that to the board , '' said Mr. Lloyd . ### `` We were reassured they would stand behind the company . '' ### Mr. Lloyd said both Qintex Entertainment and Qintex Australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ 5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on Oct. 14 . ### At that point , he said , Qintex Australia stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing . ### However a Qintex Australia spokesman said his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment . ### In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . '' ### The Qintex Australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the Chapter 11 filing . ### He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means . ### The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned Hollywood executives and investors . ### `` It 's a shocker , '' said Joseph Di Lillo , chairman of Drake Capital Securities , a brokerage firm that has an investment in Qintex Entertainment . ### Qintex Australia was `` going to pay more than $ 1 billion for and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ 5.9 million . '' ### Qintex said Mr. Evans , the former president , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that Mr. Kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying was no longer necessary . ### Mr. Kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980 . ### The announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between Qintex Australia and might be revived . ### It 's understood that recently contacted Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. , which made two failed bids for the movie studio , to see if the company was still interested . ### However , `` we are n't currently doing anything . ### It is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , '' said Barry Diller , chairman and chief executive officer of the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp . ### Financial printer Bowne & Co. said it formed a business translation service , which will provide legal , financial and other services in most major languages , including Japanese , Chinese and Russian . ### Japan 's Finance Ministry strongly denied playing any role in the New York stock-price free fall . ### Makoto Utsumi , vice minister for international affairs , said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy-out . ### The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general , Mr. Utsumi said . ### `` There are no facts -LCB- behind the assertions -RCB- that we sent any kind of signal , '' he declared in an interview . ### The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets . ### A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another . ### Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about `` the status of their participation '' in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out . ### The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . '' ### He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry . ### Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out . ### In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals . ### `` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -LCB- UAL -RCB- deal , '' he said . ### `` They are becoming more independent . ### It 's a sound phenomenon . '' ### Sanwa Bank Ltd. is one Japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first UAL proposal . ### A Sanwa Bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision . ### `` We made our own decision , '' he said . ### Still , Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks . ### All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position . ### Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads . ### `` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified . ### `` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added . ### Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason . ### Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said . ### Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats . ### Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs . ### At a news conference this week , Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals . ### Despite Mr. Sumita 's statements , it is the Finance Ministry , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions . ### While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever , Japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game . ### Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the U.S. market , bank analysts say . ### Flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas . ### Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network . ### France 's national tobacco company , known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises and Gitanes , is branching out . ### Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores . ### Brown tobacco in France is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde tobacco , used in so-called American-style cigarettes . ### `` We are n't Philip Morris Cos. , '' says Bertrand de Galle , chairman of government-owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A. , known as Seita . ### He says that because Seita 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done . ### -LRB- Last year , for example , Seita 's net profit soared 150 % to 461.6 million French francs -LRB- $ 73.5 million -RRB- on sales of FFr27.68 billion-a 1.7 % profit margin . -RRB- ### Instead , he said in an interview , he is looking for ways to exploit France 's network of 39,000 tobacco agents , most of them cafes . ### While Seita does n't own the French tabacs , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities . ### One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in Paris . ### Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops . ### Once activated , the card would sit in the car 's window , showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain . ### When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later . ### Seita is a partner in the project , which was developed by Matra SA using Japanese technology . ### Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service . ### And Seita is considering further diversification . ### It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary , Belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA . ### It currently is considering bidding for Swedish Match Co . ### And it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops . ### It also is trying to shore up its tobacco business . ### Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40 % of the French tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago . ### While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand . ### So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes . ### The aim , says Mr. de Galle , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying French . ### When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions last July , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds . ### But the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights . ### The decision , Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services , illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices . ### In the Missouri case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state 's 1986 abortion law . ### The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution . ### Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins . ### But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services . ### The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws . ### Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis . ### The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children . ### Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . '' ### Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives . ### In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling . ### Last week , when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble . ### `` The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters . ### Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion . ### Mario Mandina , president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in Missouri . ### There 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day . '' ### That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of overruling Roe vs. Wade . ### In two other cases , the possible consequences of the Supreme Court ruling appear even more unintended . ### In one , the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia , Mo. , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth . ### In Missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension . ### A Boone County judge rejected the motion , but Daniel Dodson , a Jefferson City lawyer , says he has appealed . ### And in a case filed in federal court in August , a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery . ### In terms of sheer brutality , the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world . ### The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas . ### The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill . ### Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years . ### Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre 's troops . ### In the port of Berbera , for example , hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever . ### Guns were never used : Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife . ### The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees . ### The study was done by Robert Gersony , a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide . ### What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa . ### Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks . ### Mr. Barre 's rule is crumbling fast . ### Mutinies wrack his armed forces -LRB- really just an armed gang -RRB- , which control less than half the country . ### Inflation is at record levels . ### Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu . ### Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . '' ### The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean . ### That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world . ### In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control . ### As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door . ### But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway . ### On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas . ### Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops . ### -LRB- Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon , a small country of little strategic importance -RRB- ### Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa , threatening the town of Dese , which would cut off Mr. Mengistu 's capital from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa . ### As a result , Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the Tigreans at bay . ### Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans . ### The weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the U.S. for help . ### While the Tigreans are communists , like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world , having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet-supplied Mengistu air force . ### What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre 's regime in Somalia is . ### The U.S. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa . ### Back to Somalia : The State Department , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from Mr. Barre , evinced by its decision to publish the Gersony report -LRB- which the press has ignored -RRB- ### What 's more , the U.S. has suspended $ 2.5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid . ### But this is not enough . ### Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre , when he goes the runway could go too . ### Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand . ### It is a certainty that Mr. Barre 's days are numbered . ### The U.S. should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not go down with him . ### Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be . ### But as one expert tells me : `` Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than Barre . '' ### While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia , it should continue to back former President Carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan . ### Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa . ### Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 . ### There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent . ### But the U.S. has one great advantage : The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all . ### It 's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side , but on the horn of Africa as well . ### The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre , and that should be cut fast . ### Mr. Kaplan , author of `` Surrender or Starve : The Wars Behind the Famine '' -LRB- Westview Press , 1988 -RRB- , lives in Lisbon . ### Translant Inc. , Rancho Cucamonga , Calif. , got an $ 86 million Navy contract for missile-launch systems . ### General Electric Co. received a $ 30.6 million Air Force contract for MX-missile nose cones . ### Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. was awarded a $ 19.1 million Army contract for armored-vehicle parts . ### Analytic Sciences Corp. was awarded a $ 10.1 million Air Force contract for technical support . ### McCormick Capital Inc. said the final proration factor was 0.628394 on its oversubscribed , $ 3-a-share tender offer to buy back as many as 1.1 million of its common shares . ### Payment will begin `` as soon as Oct. 25 , '' the company said . ### McCormick is a developer and manager of futures-investment limited partnerships . ### Through a separate agreement between Peter Dauchy , president , and a group of selling shareholders , the company said , Mr. Dauchy will on Oct. 30 buy 231,405 shares from the group , boosting his stake to about 717,000 shares , or 50.7 % of the total after the buy-back . ### Canada 's consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 % in September from August , Statistics Canada , a federal agency , said . ### The rise followed boosts of 0.1 % in August , 0.7 % in July and 0.6 % in June . ### OPEC 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets . ### Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out . ### But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters . ### As a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency . ### The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 . ### So far this year , rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others . ### But that could change if demand for OPEC 's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen . ### OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune . ### At that rate , a majority of OPEC 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said . ### But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC . ### Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including his own , Issam Al-Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister , told the conference Friday . ### He puts OPEC 's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day . ### That 's higher than some other estimates . ### Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day . ### Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge . ### Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market . ### The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market . ### However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member . ### Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system . ### `` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi . ### At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling . ### They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments . ### The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters . ### Still , there was a breakthrough at Geneva . ### Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling . ### But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an Iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers . ### In the end politics got in the way . ### Libya accepted Iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait . ### And the United Arab Emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways . ### But the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting . ### It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan . ### The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others . ### Libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue . ### Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some OPEC sources said . ### Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members . ### In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million . ### Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels . ### Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share . ### Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions . ### `` Under any circumstances , Saudi Arabia should get more '' rather than less , Mr. Nazer said . ### In a blow to France 's Rafale jet fighter , the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-18 Hornets to defend its aircraft carriers . ### The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within France 's military establishment over the Rafale , which is made by Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA . ### In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century . ### The air force is to take at least 250 more . ### Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack . ### Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs -LRB- $ 286.6 million -RRB- , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy . ### Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale . ### Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them . ### But unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use . ### Although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds . ### Adm. Goupil 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault . ### Although government-controlled , Dassault still is run by the founder 's son , Chairman Serge Dassault , who has fiercely protected his company 's independence . ### The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs . ### So far , Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure to change . ### What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them . ### Adm. Goupil , a former Crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use Crusaders , the Philippines , retired its last ones two years ago . ### A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here . ### Adm. Goupil rejected Dassault 's proposal to renovate the Crusaders , saying the cost was impossible to estimate . ### Even modernized , he said , the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers France has sent to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf . ### Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time . ### THE SUPREME COURT ruling upholding Missouri 's restrictive abortion law was Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services . ### The citation was misstated in Friday 's edition . ### Spending by average Japanese households in August fell an adjusted 1.9 % from a year earlier , the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister 's Office said . ### The bureau cited typhoons in the month that discouraged shopping and leisure opportunities . ### Spending by Japanese households averaged 290,782 yen -LRB- $ 2,052.10 -RRB- in August . ### In nominal terms it rose 0.6 % from a year earlier before adjustment . ### August adjusted spending by wage-earning families was down 0.6 % to 309,381 yen from a year earlier . ### The real income of wage-earning families in the month eased 1.2 % to 438,845 yen from the previous year . ### For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending . ### The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year . ### Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead . ### Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing . ### In addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes . ### And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline . ### There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC . ### `` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director . ### Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar . ### These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says . ### Ms. Hall expects Cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next . ### In 1988 , it earned $ 2.82 billion Hong Kong -LRB- US$ 361.5 million -RRB- on revenue of HK$ 11.79 billion . ### Cathay is taking several steps to bolster business . ### One step is to beef up its fleet . ### In addition to aircraft from Boeing Co. , Cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330-300s . ### The expansion , which could cost as much as US$ 5.7 billion over the next eight years , will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of last year , according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd . ### The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay 's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America . ### Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong . ### Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain . ### Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada . ### David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 . ### Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover . ### Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors . ### Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged . ### There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal . ### Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation . ### Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy . ### But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade . ### Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers . ### `` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. Eddington says . ### `` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's . ### I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . '' ### In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier . ### `` We 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' Mr. Eddington says . ### `` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas . ### We 'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok , Singapore and Manila . '' ### Asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of Cathay 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay . ### Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam . ### Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible , says Mr. Bell , the spokesman . ### While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 , such a move is n't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong . ### And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London : `` Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights . '' ### He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong 's return to China . ### A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong 's airlines , which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines , will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong 's government . ### But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing . ### `` My feeling is -LCB- Cathay does n't -RCB- have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified . ### Cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . '' ### Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future . ### `` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper . ### Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market value from the 40 % currently allowed . ### Falcon , a limited partnership , said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $ 2.15-per-unit annual payment , and for expansion and acquisitions . ### A spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year 's end . ### Friday , October 20 , 1989 ### The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions . ### PRIME RATE : 10 % . ### The base rate on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks . ### FEDERAL FUNDS : 8 % high , 8 % low , 8 % near closing bid , 8 % offered . ### Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $ 1 million or more . ### Source : Fulton Prebon -LRB- U.S.A . -RRB- Inc . ### DISCOUNT RATE : 7 % . ### The charge on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank . ### CALL MONEY : 9 % to 10 % . ### The charge on loans to brokers on stock exchange collateral . ### COMMERCIAL PAPER placed directly by General Motors Acceptance Corp. : 8.50 % 15 to 44 days ;

'' ### Out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions . ### `` It 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , '' said Barbara May . ### She went first for personal mementos . ### In post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . '' ### After being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded . ### Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes . ### Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness . ### Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows . ### It did n't help that on Saturday , after three days of sunshine , it rained . ### `` The guys are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal computers , '' said Frank Fitzgerald , who helped others empty their apartments . ### `` The women wanted photo albums , a certain brooch , kind of sentimental things . '' ### He showed an unbroken , still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman . ### It belonged to her grandfather . ### Some residents defied orders and returned to `` red '' buildings to retrieve goods . ### One building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out , and a resident who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend , telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby . ### A policewoman had to be called in to make her leave ; the policewoman helped carry out one last load . ### Enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic , residents said . ### One man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage . ### When he sneaked back later to try again , a different policeman offered to help him get the car out . ### The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake . ### On lampposts along Fillmore Street , a major Marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake . ### The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals . ### The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish . ### For example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the Marina , did n't have heat . ### `` She can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , '' says Daralee Konowitch , animalcare services manager for the SPCA . ### A warm foster home has been found . ### The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit . ### But turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb . ### Only it is safer , and busier . ### Over the past year there have been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981 . ### A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies . ### The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 . ### Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well . ### A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability . ### Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices . ### Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents . ### Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop . ### This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible . ### The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment . ### An additional benefit is the creation of jobs . ### This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers . ### It continues through the life of the center ; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job . ### As many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ 2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years . ### And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like . ### Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60 % of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects . ### Bradford Crowe , director of the mayor 's City Economic Development Office , says : `` There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood . ### What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields . '' ### Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women . ### In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago 's Third Ward , opposite the Robert Taylor Homes , 29 % of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14 % to members of other minority groups . ### Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins . ### So what 's the catch ? ### Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess . ### Security costs are also quite high . ### One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing . ### Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them . ### Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive . ### The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates . ### Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance . ### Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard . ### The security command post , camouflaged as second-story retail space , has its own `` crow 's nest '' above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center . ### Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center . ### These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group 's Grand Boulevard Plaza . ### Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center . ### Security is 60 % to 70 % of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15 % . ### These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax-free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing . ### Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back . ### However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions . ### Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities . ### These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it . ### Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date . ### With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment . ### New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets . ### If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond . ### Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves . ### The answer will be obvious . ### Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department 's National Institute of Justice . ### ATHLONE INDUSTRIES Inc. said that on Dec. 21 it will redeem $ 10 million face amount of its $ 59.3 million of 15.625 % subordinated notes outstanding , due June 1 , 1991 . ### For each $ 1,000 of notes , the maker of specialty metals , industrial fasteners and consumer products will pay $ 1,026.46 plus $ 8.68 of interest accrued from Dec. 1 . ### The company will notify holders of the notes to be redeemed . ### Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. is redemption agent . ### One company recently was listed on the New York Stock Exchange , and another will join the Big Board from the over-the-counter market this week . ### Putnam Investment Grade Municipal Trust , Boston , was listed with the symbol PGM . ### The new closed-end management investment company trades shares of beneficial interest . ### It invests primarily in tax-exempt municipal securities . ### Hibernia Corp. , a New Orleans bank holding company , will join the Big Board Thursday under HIB . ### Three companies began trading over the counter . ### Exabyte Corp. , a Boulder , Colo. , maker of high-capacity tape cartridge systems used to back up computer disk drives , started OTC trading with the symbol EXBT . ### Rally 's Inc. , a Louisville , Ky. , restaurant franchisor , started trading under RLLY . ### Sierra Tucson Cos. , Tucson , Ariz. , started trading under STSN . ### It operates various types of addiction-treatment facilities . ### Separately , on the Pacific Stock Exchange , put and call options on the common stock of Aldus Corp. started trading . ### Aldus , Seattle , makes computer software products . ### Options give a holder the right , but not the obligation , to buy or sell a security at a set price within a set period of time . ### Dow Chemical Co. said its Destec Energy Inc. unit has agreed to buy PSE Inc. , a Houston energy company , in a deal valued at about $ 115 million . ### Dow , of Midland , Mich. , said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $ 12.25 a share for all PSE common shares outstanding . ### Among other conditions , the offer depends on the Dow unit acquiring at least 66 % of the PSE shares outstanding , the companies said in a joint statement Friday . ### PSE has about 9.2 million shares outstanding . ### The company said the approximately $ 115 million acquisition price includes its total $ 33 million of long-term debt outstanding . ### Dow said it already has agreements with Albert J. Smith Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of PSE , and certain other officers of the company under which Dow may buy about 40 % of the PSE common shares outstanding . ### PSE is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $ 234 million . ### The company is owner and operator , or an equity partner , in six cogeneration facilities -- two in Texas and four in California . ### The company said recently it expects third-quarter earnings will be in range from $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share , compared with $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , a year ago . ### If growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash . ### Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks . ### Best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the New York Stock Exchange , are languishing at depressed prices . ### Growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on Oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements . ### Against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal . ### `` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares Mary Farrell , a PaineWebber analyst . ### Among her OTC picks are Oshkosh B'Gosh and A&W Brands . ### Like many OTC growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million . ### Some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long . ### These are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records . ### While many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum . ### That 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks . ### `` You can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says John Palicka , chief portfolio manager at Midco Investors , a Newark , N.J. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes . ### Mr. Palicka 's picks from the OTC market include Legent , Mail Boxes Etc. , and Payco American . ### The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy . ### `` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says L. Keith Mullins , a growth-stock analyst at Morgan Stanley . ### Eventually , he believes , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth . ### In anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now . ### Understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently . ### The average issue on Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index gained 35 % last year , Ms. Farrell of PaineWebber says . ### Smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % . ### In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year . ### Also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips . ### As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % . ### The Nasdaq Composite has gained 23 % this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 % . ### Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results . ### `` People are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. Mullins of Morgan Stanley . ### Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell . ### However , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance . ### Mark Schoeppner , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support . '' ### Barney Hallingby , managing director of research at Hambrecht & Quist , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions . ### On Friday , Hambrecht & Quist added St. Jude Medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends . ### The opinion is largely based on the company 's earnings momentum , Mr. Hallingby says . ### St. Jude 's market value on Nasdaq exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n't a small stock . ### The medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 . ### Kurt Kruger , who follows the stock for Hambrecht & Quist , anticipates that the company 's net income will grow 51 % to $ 2.15 a share this year . ### St. Jude finished up to 44 on Friday . ### Friday 's Market

it expects a net loss of $ 16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit . ### First Interstate said the unit , bludgeoned by Arizona 's worsening real-estate woes , will have a $ 174 million loss for the quarter . ### First Interstate took a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank . ### It charged off an estimated $ 200 million of Arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate . ### First Interstate made the move under pressure from regulators . ### The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter , and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard . ### Earlier last week , Valley National Corp. , the state 's largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend . ### Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about Pinnacle 's moribund Merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income . ### Security Pacific Corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ 109 million , mainly because of sour Arizona real-estate loans . ### New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp. took an $ 85 million Arizona-related charge . ### Furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind First Interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it . ### Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month ; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ 350 million third-quarter hit . ### When First Interstate balked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million . ### `` At that point , -LCB- First Interstate -RCB- decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further , '' said one industry official close to the talks . ### Thomas P. Marrie , chief financial officer , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations . ### He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . '' ### The tough regulatory stance portends large future losses , especially at the state 's thrifts . ### At least six of Arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses . ### For example , Western Savings & Loan Association , which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $ 357.4 million at June 30 . ### It had a $ 258.9 million loss in the second quarter . ### Yet it still held $ 916.3 million of repossessed real estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever . ### It also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small . ### The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion . ### Together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion . ### They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up . ### The thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second quarter . ### Other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed Arizona property , if they can sell it at all . ### All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking . ### In the late 1970s and early 1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that Arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4 % to 6 % for years to come . ### Now , annual population growth is running at about 2 % a year , some desert tracts bought three years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are being sold at $ 25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space . ### `` It 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in Phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings , '' said C.W. Jackson , a prominent Arizona businessman with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses . ### Many Arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come . ### Ralph Shattuck , publisher of Foreclosure Update newsletter , said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in Maricopa County , where Phoenix is located . ### That 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : So far this month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day . ### `` It 's frightening , '' Mr. Shattuck said . ### Moreover , Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures . ### And the generally frail condition of Arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide . ### `` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. Jackson . ### `` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end . ### The only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is : ` Pay me in 60 days . ' '' ### First Interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its Texas operations . ### For the six months ended June 30 , it reported net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a share , including $ 46 million from tax credits and accounting changes . ### The bank 's Arizona unit holds about $ 6 billion of First Interstate 's $ 50 billion of assets . ### Mr. Marrie said the bank expects Arizona real-estate prices , which plummeted 40 % over the last year , to fall another 20 % before stabilizing . ### Some in Arizona think that may be optimistic . ### First Interstate said its operations outside of Arizona `` achieved results as expected for the quarter , '' but did n't specify the results . ### First Interstate stock closed at $ 57.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange . ### Since its unsuccessful bid for BankAmerica Corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in California in 1991 . ### Mr. Marrie said the problems in Arizona have only `` increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective . '' ### Separately , Standard & Poor 's Corp. lowered its ratings on Valley National Corp. 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus , affecting about $ 300 million of long-term debt . ### S&P also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit , Valley National Bank of Arizona . ### The ratings service said the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition . ### A spokesman for Phoenix , Ariz.-based Valley National , said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in Arizona real estate . ### Commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds , he said , and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days . ### Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma . ### The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor . ### IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response . ### The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense . ### But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction . ### A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said . ### The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering . ### Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents . ### Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years . ### The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission : ### Heller Financial Inc. , an indirect subsidiary of Fuji Bank Ltd. , shelf offering of up to $ 1 billion debt securities and warrants . ### Jason Overseas Ltd. , proposed offering of five million common shares , via Smith Barney & Co. and Mabon Nugent & Co . ### MCI Communications Corp. , shelf offering of up to $ 750 million of debt securities via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , Goldman , Sachs & Co. , and Salomon Brothers Inc . ### Millicom Inc. , offering of $ 60 million subordinated exchangeable debentures , via Bear , Stearns & Co. Inc . ### Union Tank Car Co. , offering of $ 100 million of equipment trust certificates , via Salomon Brothers . ### Conner Peripherals Inc. , which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers , is on target to surpass Compaq Computer Corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in U.S. business history . ### Conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers . ### It said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72 % to $ 11.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 6.8 million , or 19 cents a share , in the year-ago period . ### Its revenue totaled $ 184.4 million , an increase of 172 % from $ 67.8 million a year ago . ### For the nine months , the San Jose , Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents a share . ### Revenue nearly tripled to $ 479 million , from $ 160 million . ### Analysts expect Conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ 40 million , or $ 1 to $ 1.05 a share , on sales of $ 650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business . ### That 's a faster growth rate than reported by Compaq , which did n't post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986 . ### But Compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up . ### Conner 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers , the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment . ### Since its inception , Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines . ### Today , Conner controls an estimated 90 % of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers . ### The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems , the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops , and to Toshiba Corp. , NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp. , the leading Japanese laptop makers . ### `` They 've had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they 've been greatly rewarded , '' said Bob Katsive , an analyst at Inc. , a market researcher in Los Altos , Calif . ### In the coming months , however , this is likely to change . ### Next month , Seagate Technology , which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers , plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers . ### And the Japanese are likely to keep close on Conner 's heels . ### `` They are going to catch up , '' said David Claridge , an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist . ### Both Toshiba and NEC already produce hard-disk drives , and Sony also is studying the field , Mr. Claridge said . ### But Conner is n't standing still . ### Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks . ### Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces . ### `` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our -LRB- older -RRB- products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name . ### `` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . '' ### These new products could account for as much as 35 % of the company 's business in 1990 , Mr. Conner estimated . ### `` We 're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , '' he said . ### Conner already is shipping its new drives . ### Last week , for instance , Compaq introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews . ### Conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase . ### From its inception , Conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as Seagate . ### The availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand for laptop computers , whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage . ### Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to Compaq , which as of July owned 40 % of Conner 's stock . ### Sales to Compaq represented 26 % of Conner 's business in its third quarter , compared with 42 % in the year-ago period . ### Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` 900 '' number has been launched in California . ### A Newport Beach law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called Telelawyer , using MCI Communication Corp. 's toll-tele-phone service . ### Cane & Associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the `` cheapest legal hour you 'll ever find . '' ### Though the service is available only in California , Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states . ### He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees . ### Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep . ### `` We will only deal with clients on the phone , '' he says . ### We have no in-office business . '' ### Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit . ### Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law . ### There also are `` 800 '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation . ### When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys . ### In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers . ### There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone . ### If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. Cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm . ### But he says Cane & Associates does n't receive referral fees . ### So far , says Mr. Cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions . ### The firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes . ### Out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1.55 . ### JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with Wedtech Corp. scandal . ### A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- and his wife , Jane Lee Garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman . ### The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer . ### The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia . ### Wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned South Bronx , N.Y. , defense contractor . ### Edward J.M. Little , one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the Garcia trial `` is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions . '' ### Mr. Little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases , including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- . ### Lawyers for the Garcias said they plan to appeal . ### Mr. Garcia , who represents New York 's 18th congressional district , which includes the Bronx , said he has n't decided whether he will resign . ### `` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. Garcia , 56 years old . ### Mrs. Garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia 's congressional staff . ### The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities . ### U.S. Judge Leonard B. Sand set the Garcias ' sentencing for Jan. 5 . ### FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving to form a new firm . ### The new firm , Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti , will be based in New York . ### The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti . ### They will be joined by Larry Gainen , who resigned from the firm of LePatner , Gainen & Block . ### Howard Rubenstein , a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould , said , `` Shea & Gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of . '' ### Mr. Rubenstein said the five , who were n't on Shea & Gould 's management committee , `` are leaving on good terms . '' ### He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm . ### Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community . ### DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in Illinois . ### While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret , the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney . ### The actual disciplinary hearings will be public . ### In addition , Illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them . ### Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct . ### Illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the American Bar Association . ### One vocal critic of the changes , Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships . ### In addition , he says , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation . ### Nevertheless , Mr. Lupel anticipates no legal action to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court 's decision to institute the changes . ### `` There 's no constitutional right involved in the rule change , '' he says . ### `` You do n't have a right to practice . ### You only have a privilege to practice . '' ### DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges . ### Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon . ### The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states . ### Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission . ### Philip Morris Cos. , whose Benson & Hedges cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at Wells Rich Greene Inc. since 1966 . ### Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account . ### Several executives said another potential contender is WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency , which works on some other Philip Morris products . ### Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined to comment . ### A spokeswoman for Ogilvy & Mather said the agency does n't comment on `` idle speculation . '' ### Also mentioned as a contender was TBWA Advertising , but the company denied it was participating . ### The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich . ### Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients . ### The account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers . ### But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million . ### Industry executives said Philip Morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share . ### According to John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va. , Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year . ### The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , Mr. Maxwell said . ### The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by Wells Rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch . ### That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing . ### Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette . ### The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance . ### Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 . ### Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business . ### Kenneth Olshan , Wells Rich 's chairman , did n't return phone calls seeking comment . ### While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million Lauren business . ### Its victories include more than $ 30 million in Sheraton Corp. business and an assignment from Dun & Bradstreet worth $ 5 million to $ 10 million . ### This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week 's earthquake . ### Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay area neared $ 5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system . ### The Bay Bridge , the main artery into San Francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks . ### Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale . ### The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day . ### Also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the 101 freeway , have been closed for repairs . ### The Bay Area Rapid Transit system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000 . ### BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught . ### Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley . ### For the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored between the East Bay and San Francisco . ### The Red and White Fleet , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip . ### That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners . ### `` I 'll stay with BART , '' said one secretary , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube . ### Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters , including East Bay residents making a long detour . ### `` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official . ### About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours . ### About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period . ### Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants . ### It also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters . ### `` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said Scott Shafer , a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos . ### City officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city . ### The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $ 2.8 billion . ### All estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $ 1 billion . ### Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage . ### The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway . ### Until it was closed Tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District . ### Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure . ### As part of the quake recovery effort , the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of the Financial District 's high-rises . ### The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that `` we were incredibly lucky , '' said Lawrence Kornfield , San Francisco 's chief building inspector . ### While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage . ### City building codes require construction that can resist temblors . ### In England , Martin Leach , a spokesman for Lloyd 's of London , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster . ### `` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. Leach said . ### On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush promised to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts . ### California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans . ### The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year . ### Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief . ### However , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum . ### G. Christian Hill and Ken Wells contributed to this article . ### Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 762.4 million -RRB- , the largest in Australian corporate history . ### That loss compared with a year-earlier profit of A$ 273.5 million . ### In preliminary , unaudited results reported Friday , Bond Corp. also posted an operating loss of A$ 814.1 million for the year ended June 30 , compared with operating profit of A$ 354.7 million a year earlier . ### Operating revenue rose 69 % to A$ 8.48 billion from A$ 5.01 billion . ### But the net interest bill jumped 85 % to A$ 686.7 million from A$ 371.1 million . ### Bond Corp. has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property . ### Much of Bond Corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of Bond Corp. 's assets and those of its units . ### The results included a A$ 453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$ 149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20 % in Lonrho PLC . ### However , Bond Corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later . ### Earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived 50 % to A$ 123.8 million from A$ 247.3 million . ### The company said the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations , G. Heileman Brewing Co. , was `` disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results . '' ### Bond Corp. 's shares closed Friday before news of the results at 28 Australian cents a share , up one Australian cent . ### The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for Alan Bond and his flagship , Bond Corp . ### Only a year ago , the chairman of Bond Corp. , who controls about 58 % of the company , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies . ### Now Bond Corp. has agreed to sell at least half its Australian brewing assets . ### It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block . ### But in a TV interview Sunday Mr. Bond said , `` We 've taken a big loss . ### We 've taken it on the chin . ### But we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business . ### Bond Corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses . ### It said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios . ### The result `` will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , '' Bond Corp. directors said in a statement . ### Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm . ### Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago . ### Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . '' ### Indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the `` true worth '' of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one . ### The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May . ### The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs . ### Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan . ### The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers . ### The owner was Israel Ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two . ### In his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220,000 , Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint . ### The first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside . ### The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged . ### Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt . ### That was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent . ### For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service . ### For creating a focus for neighborhood life . ### Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year . ### The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople . ### Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers . ### Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem . ### Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture . ### While by no means the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development . ### A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization . ### It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses . ### The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job . ### Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed . ### Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving . ### More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises . ### In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year . ### Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average . ### Crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses . ### Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records . ### He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones . ### The New York study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker . ### The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business . ### Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury . ### After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives . ### One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises . ### These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty . '' ### Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents . ### Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses . ### This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York . ### Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime . ### The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees . ### The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments . ### Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places . ### Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % . ### Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants . ### In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection . ### This creates several problems . ### One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses . ### The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents . ### Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves . ### A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses . ### Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive . ### Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses . ### But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship . ### Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas . ### For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits . ### Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density . ### With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols . ### Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect . ### While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks . ### It might even have saved the life , and business , of Israel Ortiz . ### Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington , D.C . ### ENFIELD Corp. said in Toronto that it hopes to raise 56 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 47.7 million -RRB- through a rights offering to shareholders . ### Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held . ### In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday , Enfield closed at C$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents . ### The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital . ### At last report , Enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding . ### Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick , in a CNN `` Capital Gang '' discussion Oct. 7 of House action on federal catastrophic-illness insurance : ### I think this repeal was kind of a thoughtless action , as a matter of fact . ### They will have to revisit this issue , and they 'll have to revisit it before long . ### Diversification pays . ### That 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's Friday-the-13th plunge . ### Stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more than 2 % in the week through last Thursday , according to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc . ### That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday , last Monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed . ### But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market 's slide . ### Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds . ### `` More than ever , people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio , '' said Jeremy Duffield , a senior vice president of Vanguard Group . ### That means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . '' ### One week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision . ### But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough . ### `` You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco . ### `` It 's like kicking the tires of a car . ### What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform ? '' ### General equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in the week ended Thursday , compared with a 2.32 % slide for the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index . ### But Lipper Analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations . ### Gold-oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1.15 % . ### Flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at about half the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of 1.27 % , according to Lipper . ### Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25 % of their portfolios outside the U.S . ### This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods , like the past week , when the dollar declines against other major currencies . ### With all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07 % in the week through last Thursday . ### But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price to pay : A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot . ### And Friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year 's hot investment . ### Thus , even including the latest week , the average general stock fund has soared more than 24 % so far this year , the Lipper Analytical figures show . ### By comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 % . ### Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average . ### `` That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , '' said Mr. Brouwer . ### You do n't make any real money . '' ### Over the last 20 years , for example , Mr. Brouwer says , an investor putting $ 5,000 a year in the S&P 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in Treasury bills . ### Some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on Friday the 13th . ### The $ 4 million Monetta Fund , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2.65 % return . ### Its return so far this year has been a credible 21.71 % . ### The fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30 % over its cost . ### By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , Monetta was 55 % in cash , said Robert Bacarella , president and portfolio manager . ### Last Monday , he started `` buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices . '' ### Among Mr. Bacarella 's picks : Oracle Systems , Reebok International Ltd. and Digital Microwave Corp . ### The fund 's cash position is now about 22 % , which Mr. Bacarella calls `` still bearish . '' ### Among the big stock funds , Dreyfus Fund , with more than $ 2 billion in assets , had a decline of just 1.49 % for the week and a return of 21.42 % for the year . ### Howard Stein , chairman of Dreyfus Corp. , said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13 , and about 10 % in cash . ### `` In a downward market , bonds act better , '' he said . ### `` We still think there 's a lot of unsettlement in this market . ### We believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . '' ### Many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak . ### From its high point on Thursday , Oct. 12 , to where it traded late in New York a week later , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen . ### Three International Cash Portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week . ### Because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar . ### But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines . ### All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date . ### Of the funds that fared the worst in the post-Oct . 13 week , two are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led the market slide following problems with financing for the UAL Corp . buy-out plan . ### Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for National Aviation & Technology . ### The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign , said A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical . ### Noting that equity funds are up nearly 60 % from their post-crash low on Dec. 3 , 1987 , he said that what happened last week `` may not be enough of an adjustment . ### There 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness . '' ### But investors do n't seem to think so . ### Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th . ### Vanguard Group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week . ### `` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates . ### People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities .

'' ### Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . '' ### Mr. McDonough responds : `` I 'm asking people to broaden their agendas . '' ### The son of a Seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before entering Dartmouth College . ### He earned a master 's degree in architecture from Yale . ### His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth . ### He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland . ### Living in Hong Kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies . ### At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers . ### He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont . ### At Yale , he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland . ### Mr. McDonough 's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York . ### The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big , operable windows . ### Since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution . ### To reduce it at the fund 's building , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office . ### Jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked-down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic . ### The budget was only $ 400,000 . ### `` Athens with Spartan means , '' Mr. McDonough says . ### The fund 's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees . ### Economists and administrators sit along a `` boulevard '' with street lamps and ficus trees . ### In offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight . ### Offices with outside windows have inside windows , too , to let in more real daylight . ### `` We proved a healthy office does n't cost more , '' says Frederic Krupp , executive director of the fund . ### It `` really looks beautiful and is very light , '' says Ann Hornaday , a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings . ### But , she says , `` I guess I did n't really notice the trees . ### Maybe they were hidden by all the people . '' ### Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough 's environmental concern . ### The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling , crystalline `` geode . '' ### It makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors . ### To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at Paul Stuart , however , Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country . ### The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials . ### Its developer is a Polish American , Sasha Muniak . ### He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center . ### The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in Poland now , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe . ### Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the `` Eiffel Tower of Warsaw '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of Poland . '' ### If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is Poland . ### Jessica Mathews , vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington , D.C. , says that perhaps a quarter of Poland 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution . ### The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages . ### The future of the forest remains uncertain . ### Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained . ### After all , Mr. Muniak says , `` in Poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment . ### They 're more worried about bread on the table . ### Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations . ### Net sank to $ 3.1 million , or eight cents a share , including $ 789,000 , or two cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward . ### In the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward . ### Revenue slipped 0.7 % to $ 395.3 million from $ 398.3 million . ### Pittston also owns Brink 's Inc. , the security service , and Burlington Air Express , the air-freight concern . ### In addition to expected losses tied to the labor strike , the coal group has spent almost $ 20 million since the strike began for security , the company said . ### As a result , the group 's third-quarter loss widened to $ 9.8 million from the second quarter 's $ 3.6 million . ### Pittston continues to hire replacement workers , the company said . ### Burlington 's operating profit grew to $ 9.2 million from $ 3.8 million a year earlier , Pittston said . ### While `` the tone '' of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound , seasonal factors are likely to hinder Burlington Air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter , Pittston said . ### Brink 's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures . ### In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Pittston closed at $ 18.50 a share , down 12.5 cents . ### Does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race ? ### As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani are in trouble . ### Mr. Dinkins , the Manhattan borough president , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls . ### But , in the past 10 days , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become New York 's first black mayor . ### Ordinarily , a clever opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's misfortunes . ### But Mr. Giuliani , a celebrated prosecutor , has had difficulty switching from his crime-busting , finger-pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big , troubled city . ### And now , at the crucial moment , he 's running out of money . ### This is the nation 's biggest city and , , its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician . ### Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader . ### Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star . ### But it has n't worked out that way . ### `` Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy , '' says David Garth , veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for Mayor Edward Koch , defeated by Mr. Dinkins in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary . ### The alternative -- Giuliani -- is ghastly . '' ### `` I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for Dinkins , '' says Richard Wade , a politically active professor who supported Richard Ravitch , an also-ran in the Democratic primary . ### There 's nothing on the other side . '' ### `` We 're picking up steam , '' insists Roger Ailes , Mr. Giuliani 's media consultant , whose last big campaign helped put George Bush in the White House . ### He adds : `` It just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet . '' ### But the steam may never reach the engine room . ### For , just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes 's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday . ### To help out this week , the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD 's Jack Kemp , Transportation 's Samuel Skinner and Treasury 's Nicholas Brady , according to Peter Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager . ### For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating . ### Historically , New York is almost always in trouble . ### But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past . ### This year , the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year . ### And hardly surprising , many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge , one ethnic group scrapping with another . ### `` People were n't so happy in the 1930s , '' says Thomas Lessner , another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia , the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition Mr. Giuliani hopes to emulate . ### But , at least , back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other . '' ### The 62-year-old Mr. Dinkins , an ex-Marine , has served as the city clerk and as Manhattan borough president , a job with limited executive responsibilities -LRB- `` I `` I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of David Dinkins , '' says Mr. Giuliani . -RRB- ### He defeated the contentious Mr. Koch in the Democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city 's racial and ethnic wounds . ### His general-election campaign is almost Reagan-like , all muted pictures and comforting words . ### His theme is unity , decency , humanity , bringing New York together again . ### Both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but Mr. Dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them . ### The 45-year-old Mr. Giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to Mr. Dinkins . ### `` He 's got to get Dinkins 's negatives up , '' says Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion . ### `` But our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff . ### Why , even 20 % of the Republican vote is going to Dinkins . '' ### `` It 's assault-weapons politics , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the Giuliani effort . ### For the Giuliani forces , it 's a conundrum . ### On the one hand , Mr. Giuliani wants to cut into Mr. Dinkins 's credibility . ### On the other , he seeks to convince voters he 's the new Fiorello LaGuardia -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead New York out of the mess it 's in ### It has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties -LRB- he won the Liberal endorsement -RRB- and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters . ### Mr. Mason left the campaign after telling reporters Mr. Dinkins is `` a fancy'shvartzer ' with a moustache . '' ### Shvartzer is a derogatory Yiddish word for a black person . ### Mr. Dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble . ### He can match Jackie Mason with his own Robert `` Sonny '' Carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974 . ### The Dinkins campaign paid Mr. Carson close to $ 10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day . ### Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete . ### Mr. Carson has been charged with being anti-Semitic . ### Asked about that the other day , he replied , `` Anti-Semitic ? ### I 'm anti-white . '' ### More troubling for Mr. Dinkins is his record in personal accounting . ### It began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years . ### `` I was always going to do it tomorrow , '' he explained at the time . ### And now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. , headed by his old friend and patron , Percy Sutton , to his son , David Dinkins Jr. , for $ 58,000 . ### He had valued the shares at more than $ 1 million two years earlier . ### He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's Board of Estimate . ### He says his son has n't paid for the shares . ### `` It looks like serious tax evasion , '' says Mr. Ailes , the Giuliani media consultant . ### `` It follows the same pattern as his tax returns . ### He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . '' ### `` He simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 two years later , '' says Mr. Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager . ### It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' value of the shares and their market value . '' ### So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded . ### `` The crime goes to character , '' says Ron Maiorana , a consultant to the Giuliani campaign . ### It 's serious stuff . ### He evades and ducks . ### He 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . '' ### `` It makes people think , maybe this guy is n't so squeaky clean after all , '' says Mr. Garth , Mayor Koch 's media consultant . ### The result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think . ### The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges . ### Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi , the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London 's Blackfriar 's Bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse . ### Banco Ambrosiano , which was Italy 's largest private-sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1.3 billion of debts . ### Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the Vatican bank . ### The Vatican , which denies any wrongdoing , paid $ 250 million to the Milan bank 's creditors as a `` goodwill gesture '' in 1985 . ### Italian news reports said Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official , Pavel Hnilica . ### Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione , channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland . ### Neither Mr. Hnilica , Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend . ### This business trust company said its board elected Kieran E. Burke , a consultant to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. , as chief executive officer , a new post , and as president . ### Mr. Burke succeeds Richard D. Manley , who will remain as a consultant to the company . ### Both men were unavailable to comment . ### The company also named Michael E. Gellert , a director and a major shareholder , to fill the vacant seat of chairman . ### Britain 's Serious Fraud Office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC 's International Signal & Control unit . ### The investigation , which will be coordinated with one already under way in the U.S. , follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called a `` serious '' fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary . ### International Signal & Control , Lancaster , Pa. , a defense-equipment manufacturer , was bought by Ferranti in 1987 for # 420 million -LRB- $ 670.3 million -RRB- . ### Ferranti has said that it would be forced to write off # 185 million against the phantom contracts , reducing its net asset value by more than half . ### The Serious Fraud Office , a division of London 's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes , said its work would take in `` allegations of fraud prior to , surrounding and subsequent to the merger . '' ### Ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will `` cooperate fully .

Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise . ### But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing . ### Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler , who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position . ### Comsat Video , which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms , plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings , as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams . ### Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets ' day-today affairs . ### Royal Business Group Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging Realist Inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws `` by engaging in a scheme to prevent '' Royal from acquiring Realist . ### Royal , which makes and distributes business forms , owns an 8 % stake in Realist . ### Royal contends that Realist failed to disclose material information , including Realist 's negotiations to acquire Ammann Laser Technik AG , to stockholders prior to Realist 's June 6 annual meeting . ### Royal 's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was `` designed to entrench management and thwart Royal 's offer . '' ### Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist , a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , for $ 14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase . ### The suit seeks `` in excess of $ 350,000 in damages . '' ### A Realist official said the company had n't yet received the full complaint and would n't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it . ### Winnebago Industries Inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half . ### The Forest City , Iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug. 26 . ### A year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share . ### The cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually , from 20 cents , `` would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said Frank Rolfes , an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis . ### Indeed , Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter . ### The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions . ### With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales . ### But the rate of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association . ### At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier . ### The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers . ### `` It 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said Robert Curran , who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co . ### So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases . '' ### Mr. Curran expects industry RV sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5 % from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978 . ### And he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year . ### But he said the industry has `` a good decade ahead , '' particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying RVs . ### Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in August , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year . ### The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things . ### The news sent Winnebago stock falling 62.5 cents , to $ 5.25 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading-a 52-week low . ### The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson , Winnebago 's founder and chairman . ### Based on his control of about 45 % of Winnebago 's 24.7 million shares , his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ 2.2 million from $ 4.4 million . ### For the year , Winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Sales rose 2 % to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million . ### Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again . ### As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative . ### And that , they say , will be good for bonds . ### `` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities . ### Mr. Platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . '' ### Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks . ### That would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease . ### Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall . ### But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled . ### Long-term bonds have performed erratically this year . ### For example , a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and % in the third quarter . ### Total return is price changes plus interest income . ### Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins . ### Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed . ### At the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating . ### Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh . ### I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . '' ### The federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy . ### Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9 % , where it had been since July , to about 8 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report . ### Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 % . ### James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall . ### `` Given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , '' he said . ### Mr. Kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term Treasurys . ### He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities . ### `` If the -LCB- Tennessee Valley Authority -RCB- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said . ### TVA , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week . ### Strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion . ### TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government . ### But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities . ### Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction . ### Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes . ### Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . ### All of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in November . ### So far , investors have n't shown much appetite for Refcorp 's initial bond offering . ### Roger Early , a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp. , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention . ### `` Why should I bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? '' he said . ### `` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . '' ### He seems to be typical of many professional money managers . ### When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about percentage point more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond . ### On Friday , the yield was quoted at about percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand . ### Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply . ### But once the new securities are digested , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data . ### `` The supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said Samuel Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc . ### If one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply is coming . '' ### Friday 's Market Activity ### Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline . ### Junk bond prices moved higher , however . ### In early trading , Treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among Japanese investors would continue . ### Also providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks . ### Those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance . ### Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as point , or about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount . ### The benchmark 30-year bond , which traded as high as 102 during the day , ended at 101 . ### The yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.98 % from 7.96 % . ### In the corporate bond market , traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. 's $ 475 million junk bond offering Friday . ### Today , for example , underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. said they expect to price a $ 150 million , 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by Imo Industries Inc . ### Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % . ### Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month . ### However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done . ### `` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc . ### If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . '' ### Last week , underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market . ### And pressure by big investors forced Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to sweeten Chicago & North Western 's $ 475 million junk bond offering . ### After hours of negotiating that stretched late into Thursday night , underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield 14.75 % , higher than the 14.5 % that had been expected . ### The coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 . ### However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 % . ### Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company . ### `` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson . ### We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . '' ### The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors . ### In the secondary , or resale , market , junk bonds closed point higher , while investment-grade corporate bonds fell to point . ### Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off . ### The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection . ### That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house . ### Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold . ### The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings . ### An Henri Matisse , auctioned last Wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist . ### In addition , a handful of paintings from the Dorrance collection remain to be sold at Sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in January . ### The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , Better Book Inc . ### The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 . ### Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories . ### The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale . ### The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book . ### The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 . ### McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3 % of LIN Broadcasting Corp . ### Morgan Guaranty Trust , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank , an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said . ### Further , McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks . ### Morgan , Toronto-Dominion and Provident are leading that syndicate . ### McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in McCaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern . ### The offer is in limbo , however , because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp . ### In national over-the-counter trading Friday , LIN shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625 . ### Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution . ### The official Xinhua News Agency said the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes . ### It quoted Liu Changyi , deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases . ### Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations . ### The Communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world . ### Japan agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory , a spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said . ### Earlier , Japan had said it might file a reservation against the ivory ban decided by ballot at the 103-nation United Nations Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species in Switzerland last week . ### The Japanese use 40 % of the world 's ivory . ### Italy should close the Leaning Tower of Pisa because it 's a danger to tourists , government-appointed experts said . ### `` In some places the stonework is so damaged it shows signs of breaking off , '' scientists and technicians said in a report to Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini . ### Each year , nearly a million people pay about $ 3 to make the spiral climb up 294 steps to the top of the 800-year-old marble tower . ### East Germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices . ### Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted ; but to reduce it further , he said , production and supply of other beverages , including fruit juices , should be stepped up . ### He added that shops will have to continue reducing their stocks of liquor and avoid displaying them too prominently in the window . ### Hong Kong has built a detention center for illegal immigrants from China because China has refused for the past two weeks to accept them back . ### The center , close to Hong Kong 's border with China , will be ready today and will be able to house 1,000 inmates , Police Deputy Director Peter Wong said . ### The dispute started when China , angry that Hong Kong had allowed dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S. , halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony , which reverts to Beijing 's control in 1997 . ### Sweating under the glare of newly installed television lights , British members of Parliament demanded a halt to the experimental televising of debates . ### A group of senior Conservative legislators , complaining the House of Commons was like a sauna , demanded that the experiment be stopped unless the intensity of the lights is reduced . ### One Conservative MP , David Wilshire , said : `` I should have a wonderful suntan by Christmas . '' ### Debates are due to be broadcast nationally starting Nov. 21 in a six-month experiment . ### A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to Mexico under the Brady plan because they 're uncertain the Mexican economy will remain stable . ### Instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , Japanese banking officials said . ### The plan , proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans . ### The officials said that most Japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending . ### But an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other Third World nations , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable . ### `` They ca n't take the hit '' to their earnings , he said . ### As a result , the official said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later . ### A poll in male-dominated South Korea put Margaret Thatcher first on a list of most-respected foreign leaders . ### The British prime minister was the only woman singled out by respondents , who put Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in second place . ### The Soviet newspaper Trud reported that Mickey Mouse will appear in a Russian-language comic book to be issued four times a year by Soviet publisher Fizkultura i Sport and Denmark 's Gutenberghus Group . ### The comic book will cost about $ 2 . ### Ekco Group Inc. , Nashua , N.H. , expects to report that net income in the third quarter , ended Oct. 1 , fell 50 % to 60 % from $ 2.1 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility . ### Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role , he said in an interview . ### But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a share , in 1988 . ### That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that Mr. Stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate . ### In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share . ### Third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ 40 million to $ 45 million , up from $ 38.2 million a year earlier , according to Neil Gordon , treasurer . ### The year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's Woodstream Corp. unit , acquired last January , but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 . ### August through October traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business , as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items . ### Mr. Stein said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in September but have been ordering more heavily in October . ### Mr. Stein said Woodstream is `` marginally profitable '' but has n't performed as well as expected . ### Woodstream 's Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said . ### But the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering from a `` depressed market , '' and Ekco is seeking to sell that segment , he said . ### Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987 . ### Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . -RRB- ### Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit . ### By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said . ### In addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands . ### Ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at factories in the U.S. and Canada . ### The main issue in the strike at the Ohio facility was health-care benefits , Mr. Stein said . ### The strike ended Oct . ### Ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , Mr. Stein said . ### He indicated that Ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ 75 million to $ 100 million , partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , suppliers . ### After several years of booming business with China , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade . ### The imposition of austerity measures , starting last October , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter . ### Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects . ### And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash . ### Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems . ### Last year 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories . ### The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half . ### The June killings magnified the problems . ### In Canton , Givaudan 's representative office received no orders in June . ### At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months . ### `` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says . ### He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million . ### The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest . ### But in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch . ### `` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist . ### On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . '' ### China 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade . ### The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange . ### The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation . ### In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback . ### `` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company . ### Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half . ### In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier . ### The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze . ### Exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to Chinese customs figures . ### The threat to China 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings . ### The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in June from $ 19 billion in April . ### The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports . ### In recent weeks , China 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities . ### The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses . ### Beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export . ### For example , Nissho Iwai Corp. , one of the biggest Japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country . ### Three years ago , the ratio was reversed . ### But the strategy is n't helping much this time . ### `` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office . ### He expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year . ### For a short time after June 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright . ### Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties . ### Even the Bank of China , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health . ### But when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen . ### The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers . ### Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say . ### Shanghai Investment & Trust Co. , known as Sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business . ### Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer . ### Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash . ### `` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a Hong Kong executive who is familiar with Sitco 's business . ### How can it make available funds for purchases ? '' ### Foreign traders also say many of China 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit . ### Albert Lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months . ### `` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says . ### Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years . ### And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years . ### Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics . ### These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly . ### But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices . ### To stem speculation , Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year . ### Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock . ### The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market . ### But Beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business . ### Mr. Kamm , the China trade expert , estimates that as much as 50 % of Guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials . ### Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws ### AN UNRESOLVED two-year-old dispute stemming from an Alaskan oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents . ### The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills . ### On July 2 , 1987 , the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet . ### Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $ 104.8 million . ### Defendants include British Petroleum America ; Trinidad Corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund . ### The fund was created by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $ 14 million in damages . ### The fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ 86 million . ### The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief . ### But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined . ### Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability . ### It claims the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages . ### That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far . ### The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , a sponsor of the bill . ### The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . '' ### Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End ### RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class . ### Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school . ### `` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course . ### In the past , associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who acted as mentors . ### But these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes . ### The Hildebrandt course enables students to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals . ### Students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect . ### Many law firms sponsor their own programs . ### At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course . ### Partners lecture on how to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers . ### Now , clients know that new associates have had some practical training before working on their cases , says James J. Hanks , a partner at the firm . ### Los Angeles Creates A Courthouse for Kids ### THE CHILDREN of Los Angeles will soon have their own $ 52 million courthouse . ### The building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , '' says Edmund Edelman , chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors . ### Designs call for an L-shaped structure with a playground in the center . ### There will be recreation and movie rooms . ### Teens will be able to listen to music with headsets . ### Study halls , complete with reference materials , will be available . ### And there will be a nurse 's station and rooms for children to meet with social workers . ### The building 's 25 courtrooms will be smaller , says Charlene Saunders , a court administrator . ### The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals . ### Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building . ### `` We need to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. Edelman . ### About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month . ### The courthouse , to be built in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 . ### Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding ### IT PAYS to follow a management career path -- even at law firms . ### That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc. , an Ardmore , Pa. , law firm consultant . ### Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years . ### Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend over half their time supervising their firms ' day-to-day operations and just a little more than a third of their time practicing law . ### Partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of about $ 217,000 . ### Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo . ### The sweeping measure incorporates $ 500 million in small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway-construction funds and $ 1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters . ### The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday . ### The measure is scheduled to be taken up by the Appropriations Committee today . ### The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration . ### `` We will support it , we will thank him , and we will augment it where appropriate , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- . ### Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments . ### `` Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , '' the legislation reads , and the new obligations `` shall not be a charge against the Budget Act , Gramm-Rudman-Hollings , or other ceilings . ### Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments . ### Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any effect on us . ### We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . '' ### The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 . ### Moody 's said it also lowered the ratings of $ 70 million of Pinnacle 's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2 , and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa . ### MeraBank 's rating for short-term deposits remains Not Prime . ### Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May , and will remain under review for downgrade , the agency said . ### First , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s . ### Then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s . ### What now ? ### To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety . ### Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing . ### Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' -LRB- North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it . ### Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood . ### Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer . ### Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera . ### After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . '' ### But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped . ### They seem to be having the `` worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit . '' ### It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do . ### Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives . ### Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold . ### While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom . ### In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security . ### The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere . ### The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty . ### In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters . ### The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -LRB- even the characters ' own -RRB- are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters . ### But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition . ### In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction . ### `` Rascal Money '' -LRB- Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world . ### Patrician dynamic Scott Thatcher , , initially finds the takeover threat risible . ### But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal . ### Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel . ### And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out . ### Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures . ### Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions . ### Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process . ### Ms. Rubin is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles . ### High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow , so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market . ### Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan , not everyone here is ready to give up . ### A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s . ### With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government . ### Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick . ### Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans . ### It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television . ### Two other firms , Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays . ### The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set . ### Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade . ### Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment . ### But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels . ### General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France . ### `` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says . ### The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized . ### `` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging . ### He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that . ### The Bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for now . ### The only material support it is extending to the struggling U.S. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . ### The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending . ### The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion . ### `` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a chance , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president . ### Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories . ### But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording . ### In the 1970s , Mr. Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's research labs in Pittsburgh . ### The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image . ### In 1979 , however , Westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television . ### Mr. Brody left the company to find other backers . ### He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers . ### `` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says . ### They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . '' ### Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds . ### `` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office . ### So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds . ### HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders . ### The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks . ### The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries . ### `` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues Jack Clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation . ### The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . '' ### Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds . ### Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial . ### They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department 's concern over their future . ### They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and Toshiba , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs . ### And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas . ### Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free . ### `` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says . ### We just have n't learned what it takes to compete . ### Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5 % stake in the company . ### The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday . ### SHV , of the Netherlands , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah . ### Burmah said it had n't held any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation . ### The top state environmental official in Massachusetts said Clean Harbors Inc. 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in Braintree was inadequate . ### The official , John DeVillars , asked Clean Harbors for more information before ruling on a permit for the site . ### Critics of the plan , including the town of Braintree , say the incinerator is a health hazard . ### Clean Harbors , based in Quincy , said it `` will proceed expeditiously '' to submit the data requested . ### Alan McKim , chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said he was `` very much encouraged '' by the official 's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report . ### Citizens & Southern Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Security Pacific Corp. 's New York-based factoring unit . ### Terms of the bank holding companies ' agreement were n't disclosed . ### Factoring involves the purchase and collection of another company 's receivables . ### Citizens , based in Atlanta , said it has about $ 4.6 billion in factored sales annually ; the Security Pacific unit has about $ 1.8 billion annually . ### Security Pacific 's factoring business works with companies in the apparel , textile and food industries , among others . ### The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman , a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville , Texas , from working in any financial institution insured by the government . ### The office , a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public . ### Generally , regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past . ### Indeed , the OTS said that before the law took effect Aug. 9 , it banned another `` key Vision Banc insider '' from insured financial institutions . ### That individual was n't identified . ### Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March , and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts . ### The OTS did n't say specifically why the action was taken against Ms. Garman . ### However , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials . ### Ms. Garman could n't be reached for comment . ### Arizona Instrument Corp. said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $ 600,000 , or 25 cents to 27 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 214,000 , or 10 cents a share , a year earlier . ### The Tempe , Ariz. , maker of underground fuel-storage systems said the most recent period was affected by customers ' problems complying with recent Environmental Protection Agency regulations . ### For the nine months , the company expects to post a net loss of about $ 879,000 , or 35 cents to 40 cents a share , on revenue of $ 6.5 million . ### A year earlier , it had a loss of $ 199,203 or nine cents a share , on revenue of $ 7.6 million . ### Growth is good . ### At least , that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers . ### They are starting to buy growth stocks . ### Remember them ? ### The upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty 50 '' companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin . ### That sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years . ### The current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones . ### Those are unwelcome trends in a year that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 23 % so far , even with the 190.58-point plunge on Oct. 13 ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood . ### The question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains . ### That 's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks . ### `` I think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , '' says Steven Einhorn , partner at Goldman Sachs . ### Growth stocks may be as big as Philip Morris or medium-sized such as Circuit City Stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15 % to 20 % a year , money managers say . ### `` The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , '' says Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income Fund . ### Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading . ### This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds John Calverley , senior economist for American Express Bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known as the `` nifty 50 . '' ### And they will again , say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme . ### Cabanne Smith , president of a money management company bearing his name , predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings `` momentum '' will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further . ### He also thinks foreign investors , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices . ### `` We 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , '' Mr. Smith says . ### Mr. Smith recommends Cypress Semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings growth rate . ### Ronald Sloan , executive vice president of Siebel Capital Management , likes Wellman Inc. , a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting . ### Mr. Sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years . ### Wellman stock closed Friday at 39 , up ; Mr. Sloan thinks that in a year it could hit 60 . ### Others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks . ### Carmine Grigoli , chief market strategist for First Boston , who still says , `` We expect the Dow average -LCB- to be at -RCB- 3000 by mid-1990 , '' nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime . ### He recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as Philip Morris , PepsiCo , CPC International , Reebok International , and Limited Inc . ### All have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20 % a year . ### Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle . ### `` One of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price . ### James Wright , chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . '' ### He recently trimmed his portfolio of International Paper , Dow Chemical , Quantum Chemical , International Business Machines and Digital Equipment . ### He is putting money in Dress Barn , Circuit City Stores , Bruno 's , and Rubbermaid . ### Big cyclical companies are using `` all the tricks they can to stabilize earnings , '' says Mr. Sloan . ### He cites IBM , which reported a 30 % earnings decline in the third quarter , and which last week announced a $ 1 billion buy-back of its shares . ### `` What they are telling you is that they do n't have the ability to generate higher returns internally , '' says Mr. Sloan . ### `` When they are buying back stock at 10 times earnings , they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below '' returns on the stock . ### IBM says it considers its shares a good investment . ### But not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals . ### Growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the Federal Reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy . ### Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Einhorn , for one , subscribes to that scenario . ### He suggests investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead , as well as growth issues . ### Friday 's Market Activity ### Stock prices finished about unchanged Friday in quiet expiration trading . ### Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks . ### But there were fewer price swings than expected . ### Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the New York Stock Exchange . ### But block trading desks and money managers made a concerted effort to meet the imbalances with stock to sell , one trader said . ### As a result , the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted in narrow ranges in the final hour of trading , and closed 5.94 higher to 2689.14 . ### New York Stock Exchange volume was 164,830,000 . ### Advancers on the Big Board lagged decliners 662 to 829 . ### For the week , the industrial average gained 119.88 points , or 4.7 % , the biggest weekly point advance ever and a better than 50 % rebound from the 190.58 point loss the industrial average logged Oct. 13 . ### Broader market averages were little changed in the latest session . ### Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index gained 0.03 to 347.16 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.02 to 325.50 , and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.05 to 192.12 . ### Most of last week 's surge in the industrial average came on Monday , when the average rose 88.12 points as market players snapped up blue-chip issues and shunned the broad market . ### That contrast was reflected in the smaller weekly percentage gains recorded by the broader averages . ### The S&P 500 rose 4 % , the Dow Jones Equity Market index gained 3.7 % and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 3.5 % . ### The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 32.71 to 1230.80 amid renewed weakness in the airline sector . ### UAL skidded 21 to 168 on 2.2 million shares . ### On the week , UAL was down nearly 40 % . ### The latest drop followed a decision by British Airways , which had supported the $ 300-a-share buy-out offer for UAL from a labor-management group , not to participate in any revised bid . ### British Airways fell 1 to 31 . ### While most other airline issues took their cue from UAL , USAir Group rose 1 to 43 on 1.5 million shares amid speculation about a possible takeover proposal from investor Marvin Davis . ### USA Today reported that Mr. Davis , who had pursued UAL before dropping his bid Wednesday , has acquired a stake of about 3 % in USAir . ### Unocal fell 1 to 52 and Burlington Resources declined to 45 . ### At a meeting with analysts , British Petroleum officials dispelled speculation that the company may take over a U.S. oil company , according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report . ### Both Unocal and Burlington had been seen as potential targets for a British Petroleum bid . ### Paper and forest-products stocks

renamed Comair Aviation Academy and will continue to be headed by Scott Williams , a son of its founder , Comair said . ### The collapse of a $ 6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has handed Wall Street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal . ### Their $ 700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ 400 million in paper losses the takeover traders , known as arbitragers , suffered in 1982 when Gulf Oil Co. dropped a $ 4.8 billion offer for Cities Service Co . ### In the six trading days since the UAL labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing , culminating Friday with the withdrawal of its partner British Airways PLC , UAL stock has plummeted by 41 % to 168 from 285 . ### The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again , as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of Cities Service . ### In the meantime , the question faced by investors is : What is UAL stock worth ? ### The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share . ### That 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year . ### Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings . ### That 's because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy . ### That analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , UAL has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings . ### So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event . ### One analyst , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid `` in the $ 225 area , '' but that it could take three to four months to close . ### At that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes UAL stock should trade closer to ### Other observers note that UAL 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal . ### By that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months , even though the eventual price might be higher . ### Investment bankers following UAL agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success . ### The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds . ### On Friday , they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them . ### However , investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ 5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17 % in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July . ### Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal . ### That way , they figure , someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs . ### Banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader . ### That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ 1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone . ### One obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership . ### Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they , not the pilots , must have control . ### One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders . ### The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking . ### But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders . ### The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied . ### In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions . ### Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 . ### First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection . ### Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike . ### And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets , First Boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share . ### Unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month . ### American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results . ### Some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots . ### The deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , `` so many moving parts . ### I do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . '' ### In addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in Washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt . ### In the meantime , the arbs are bleeding . ### Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding . ### Frank Gallagher , an analyst with Phoenix Capital Corp. in New York , estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $ 280 a share for their UAL positions . ### That would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on UAL alone totalling $ 725 million . ### UAL Corp . -LRB- NYSE ; Symbol : UAL -RRB- ### Business : Airline ### Year ended Dec. 31 , 1988 : ### Sales : $ 8.98 billion ### Net income : $ 599.9 million ; or $ 20.20 a share ### Second quarter , June 30 , 1989 : Per-share earnings : $ 6.52 vs. $ 5.77 ### Average daily trading volume : 881,969 shares ### Common shares outstanding : 21.6 million ### Eastern Enterprises , bolstered by improved tonnages in its marine-shipping unit , had a narrower third-quarter net loss of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share . ### Last year , Eastern had a quarter loss of $ 1.7 million , or eight cents a share . ### Quarter revenue rose 44 % to $ 160.1 million from $ 111.2 million a year ago . ### The Weston , Mass. , utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter , usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business , were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company . ### For the nine months , Eastern had net income of $ 41.8 million , or $ 1.80 a share , up 23 % from $ 33.9 million or $ 1.46 a share a year ago . ### Revenue grew 24 % to $ 614.5 million from $ 497.1 million . ### Convex Computer Corp. , continuing its rapid growth while other computer companies falter , reported an 87 % increase in third-quarter net income from a year earlier and a 50 % increase in revenue . ### Net was $ 3.1 million , or 16 cents a share , up from $ 1.6 million , or nine cents a share . ### Revenue was $ 41.2 million , up from $ 27.5 million . ### For the nine months , net was $ 7.7 million , or 41 cents a share , up 97 % from $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue was $ 111.9 million , up 50 % from $ 74.8 million . ### Convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $ 2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide . ### During the third quarter , it said , it won several significant contracts , including a five-year contract with the National Institutes of Health valued at an estimated $ 8 million . ### Earlier this month , Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems . ### The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers , which `` opens up a phenomenal market for us , '' said Robert J. Paluck , Convex 's chairman , president and chief executive . ### Convex also recently agreed to use Posix , a standard for the computer language called UNIX . ### Posix is one of three or four versions of UNIX , but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems . ### Most other supercomputer manufacturers have yet to adopt the Posix standard , Mr. Paluck said , adding that they prefer to maintain proprietary systems that lock in customers . ### `` They want a lobster trap -- once you get in , you ca n't get out , '' he said . ### But the customer does n't want that . '' ### Convex closed in over-the-counter trading on Friday at $ 15.375 a share , down 12.5 cents . ### Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including Interpublic Group , but has rejected them , people familiar with the company said . ### Industry executives said Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit , but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi . ### More recently , Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said . ### Interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , Philip Geier Jr. , made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London , the executives said . ### A Saatchi spokesman declined to comment about Interpublic . ### But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units . ### He added , `` We have no intention of selling either business . '' ### Interpublic declined comment . ### The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history . ### Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring . ### Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak . ### In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses . ### It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus . ### It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi . ### And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged . ### But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses . ### While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive . ### Campbell-Mithun-Esty , for example , has had big problems at its New York office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including Minneapolis and Chicago . ### That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence . ### While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi 's other agencies . -RRB- ### Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , and Dow Brands . ### Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms . ### It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own . ### Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm . ### Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units . ### Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . '' ### Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses . ### Prudential 's Final Four ### Prudential Insurance Co. of America said it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $ 70 million account . ### In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates , a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk , a unit of the Lowe Group ; Grey Advertising ; and WPP Group 's Scali , McCabe , Sloves agency . ### All agencies are New York-based . ### A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in Newark , N.J. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months . ### Jamaica Fires Back ### The Jamaica Tourist Board , in the wake of Young & Rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident . ### The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges . ### Among other things , the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would `` embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board . '' ### It also contends that Young & Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures , a Jamaican firm hired by the agency . ### The U.S. indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism . ### The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement Thursday that it would no longer handle the $ 5 million to $ 6 million account . ### The agency declined comment , but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen . ### Ad Notes . ### NEW ACCOUNT : American Suzuki Motor Corp. , Brea , Calif. , awarded its estimated $ 10 million to $ 30 million account to , Los Angeles . ### Also participating in the finals was Los Angeles agency Hakuhodo Advertising America . ### American Suzuki 's previous agency , , did n't participate . ### AYER TALKS : N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J.

Walter Thompson agency in Chicago . ### Shelly Lazarus , 42 , was named president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct , the direct mail division of WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency . ### Grand Metropolitan PLC , the United Kingdom food and beverage group that owns Pillsbury Inc. of the U.S. , announced a reshuffling of board-level executive duties intended to fit the company 's recent expansion . ### David Nash , formerly group finance director at Cadbury Schweppes PLC , will become Grand Met 's first group finance director in January . ### In a statement , Grand Met said its recent `` growth and wider geographic spread '' made it necessary to create the new position . ### The company also reassigned several executive responsibilities . ### David Tagg , formerly in charge of gambling operations , was appointed chief executive for retailing and property . ### Peter Cawdron , group strategy development director , and Bill Shardlow , group personnel director , will become part of the board 's management committee . ### David Baltimore , who has just been named president of Rockefeller University , already knows what it 's like to go through life with `` Nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name . ### He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name . ### The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second . ### Both of Dr. Baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution . ### It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore 's impending appointment . ### They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore . ### Readers of these columns -LRB- `` The Science Police , '' May 15 -RRB- will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere . ### Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper . ### Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era . ### This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science . ### John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules . ### Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell . ### Mr. Dingell , by the way , has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper , adding to several previous investigations . ### Something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here . -RRB- ### Fortunately , there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out . ### David Hubel , a Nobel laureate at Harvard , has taken the lead in defending research with animals , as has Dr. Michael DeBakey . ### NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch . ### Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power . ### In a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work . ### When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support . ### Wisconsin Toy Co. said it definitively agreed to acquire closely held Everything 's a Dollar Inc. of Virginia Beach , Va. , for stock currently valued at about $ 4.7 million . ### The Milwaukee toy retailer said the agreement calls for Everything 's a Dollar holders to receive for their holdings a total of 354,600 newly issued Wisconsin Toy shares . ### Wisconsin Toy currently has about 4.7 million shares outstanding . ### A company official said Arthur Borie , until January chief operating officer of Pic 'N Save Inc. , will buy a 20 % stake in the new Wisconsin Toy subsidiary , and will act as head of Everything 's a Dollar . ### Wisconsin Toy has 71 retail stores , primarily in discount settings . ### Everything 's a Dollar operates 60 specialty-retail stores . ### While welcoming Nicholas McInnes 's Sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your `` World-Wide Tax Revolution '' table -LRB- editorial page , Aug. 29 -RRB- , I am surprised that he neglected other errors that , for some of us , strike close to home . ### As a Channel Islander , I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of `` 86 countries with an income tax .

Hawkins , chairman of Jet Vacations Inc. , was elected to the board of this cruise line . ### The board expands to seven members . ### , under OMB Director Richard Darman 's formulation that `` if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's a duck . '' ### George Bush is quite clear : No new ducks . ### But what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over Washington ? ### We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities . ### Federal child care -LRB- quack -RRB- . ### The Clean Air bill -LRB- quack -RRB- . ### The disabled-workers bill -LRB- quack , quack -RRB- . ### The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did : It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air , better treatment of the disabled , better child care . ### It comes up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal . ### The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from . ### Consider , for instance , the very fat fowl known as federalized child care . ### The President came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill . ### It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services . ### They 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities . ### The initial costs are said to be in the $ 2 billion a year range , but that 's only the beginning . ### New entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes . ### The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range . ### The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways . ### For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants . ### So instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants . ### The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology . ### The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in Big Sky , Montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles . ### Proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $ 500 per car . ### Other analysts say that estimate is low . ### Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With Disabilities Act will cost , because nobody knows what the bill entails . ### It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation . ### Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts . ### Lawyers will benefit . ### Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill . ### The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions . ### All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments . ### Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s . ### In fact , during last year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief . ### `` Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business , '' the vice president declared when he was head of the task force . ### But with the impending passage of these new programs , Mr. Bush will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back . ### By 1986 , the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000 . ### Then it turned up , and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year . ### Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the Bush presidency . ### We would have thought by now , though , that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy . ### It is merely the most obvious . ### What is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire . ### But while they are unloading these burdens , the United States is close to creating three more big ones . ### The Bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks . ### Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September , due for release tomorrow , fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits . ### Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week . ### But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday . ### This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound , economists and foreign exchange market analysts say . ### `` The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side , '' said Chris Dillow , senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute . ### `` If there is another bad trade number , there could be an awful lot of pressure , '' noted Simon Briscoe , U.K. economist for Midland Montagu , a unit of Midland Bank PLC . ### Forecasts for the trade figures range widely , but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # 2 billion -LRB- $ 3.2 billion -RRB- deficit in the current account reported for August . ### The August deficit and the # 2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the # 2.3 billion deficit of October 1988 . ### Sanjay Joshi , European economist at Baring Brothers & Co. , said there is no sign that Britain 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports . ### At the same time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows . ### He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September . ### However , Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports . ### Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3 billion . ### Mr. Briscoe , who also forecasts a # 1.3 billion current account gap , warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions . ### Nevertheless , he noted , `` No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position '' in the pound . ### Meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded . ### In his Mansion House speech , Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect . ### U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years . ### But consumer expenditure data released Friday do n't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly . ### The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago . ### This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 . ### Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises . ### Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further . ### Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . '' ### Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary . ### And , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow . ### Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday . ### In European trading it declined to $ 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $ 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday . ### Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged . ### Friday 's Market Activity ### The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . ### Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . ### Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve . ### Late in the New York trading day , the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York . ### The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday . ### In Tokyo on Monday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.95 yen , up from Friday 's Tokyo close of 141.35 yen . ### On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367.30 an ounce , up 20 cents . ### Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces . ### In early trading in Hong Kong Monday , gold was quoted at $ 366.50 an ounce . ### East Rock Partners Limited Partnership said it proposed to acquire A.P. Green Industries Inc. for $ 40 a share . ### In an Oct. 19 letter to A.P. Green 's board , East Rock said the offer is subject to the signing of a merger agreement by no later than Oct. 31 . ### The letter , attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said the approval is also contingent upon obtaining satisfactory financing . ### An A.P. Green official declined to comment on the filing . ### The $ 40-a-share proposal values the company at about $ 106.6 million . ### A.P. Green currently has 2,664,098 shares outstanding . ### Its stock closed at $ 38 , up $ 1.875 , in national over-the-counter trading . ### The company is a Mexico , Mo. , maker of refractory products . ### East Rock also said in the filing that it boosted its stake in A.P. Green to 8.7 % . ### It now holds 233,000 A.P. Green common shares , including 30,000 shares bought last Thursday for $ 35.50 to $ 36.50 a share . ### New York-based John Kuhns and Robert MacDonald control East Rock Partners Inc. , the sole general partner of East Rock Partners L.P . ### The sole limited partner of the partnership is Westwood Brick Lime Inc. , an indirect subsidiary of Westwood Group Inc . ### Both Westwood Brick and Westwood Group are based in Boston . ### Freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation . ### Trucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport . ### Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years . ### That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad . ### `` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co . ### Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year . ### Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years . ### `` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus . ### The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation . ### Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill . ### Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . ### But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates . ### `` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde . ### `` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years . ### Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . '' ### Robert Delaney , a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions . ### Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor . ### You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . '' ### Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers . ### `` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . ### Less-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April . ### The carriers were competing fiercely for market share . ### Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . ### An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . '' ### Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . ### Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . ### And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said . ### Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . ### And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years . ### Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan . ### Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years . ### Some bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3 % to 4 % in the past few months , '' said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd . ### And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates . ### Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . ### Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April . ### MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . ### The Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering . ### The hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will lead the underwriters . ### Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand and theme park . ### Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination . ### Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair ; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons . ### Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing . ### At the scheduled time , Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked . ### After the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` Go ahead and tell us what happened . ### We may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . '' ### No lawyers or tape recorders were present . ### The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists , one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture . ### Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . ### He talked about 20 minutes . ### When he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . ### The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . ### Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real . ### It happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles . ### The court is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year . ### Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis , the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis , a General Electric plant in Columbia , Md. , or a number of other companies . ### These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process . ### Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry . ### In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it . ### Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons . ### It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations . ### It helps to keep out unions . ### It increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control . ### What must your management team do to establish corporate due process ? ### Here are four key steps : ### 1 . Make sure you have a strong personnel department . ### It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases . ### At Polaroid , the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages . ### At TWA , the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists . ### At Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution . ### In a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment . ### In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle . ### 2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach . ### See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators . ### Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately . ### In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen . ### In the 15 companies I studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . ### 3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator . ### A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support . ### An adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy . ### International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach . ### 4 . Make your due-process system visible . ### It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it . ### Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . ### On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . ### Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . ### Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . ### At IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive . ### Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale , chief executive and chief operating officer , respectively , sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases . ### Mr. Ewing is a consultant based in Winchester , Mass. , and author of `` Justice on the Job : Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace '' -LRB- Harvard

Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index rose 101.98 points to 35588.36 . ### Friday 's volume on the First Section was estimated at one billion shares , up from 862 million Thursday . ### Winners outpaced losers , 572 to 368 , while 181 issues remained unchanged . ### With investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe the market was back to normal . ### The Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking . ### `` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session . ### The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 . ### The Second Section index , which rose 15.72 points Thursday , was up 11.88 points , or 0.32 % , to close at 3717.46 . ### Volume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares , up from 28 million Thursday . ### In turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks , the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday . ### But the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13 . ### The Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo . ### The Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week , adding 1017.69 points in four days -- more than erasing Monday 's losses . ### But further major advances on the Nikkei are n't foreseen this week by market observers . ###

key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 , above its intraday low of 2176.9 , but off the day 's high of 2189 . ### The index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall . ### London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September . ### The FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower . ### The FT 30-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0 . ### Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares . ### Dealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday . ### They added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares . ### Interest may remain limited into tomorrow 's U.K. trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months . ### The key corporate news of the

endanger their lives , government officials said . ### The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee . ### The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday . ### Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . ### According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . ### They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . ### No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . ### What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . ### The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules . ### However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . ### It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad . ### A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama . ### The statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government . ### Not only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . '' ### Sen. Boren said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future . ### I 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . '' ### Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . '' ### Sen. Boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules . ### But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress . ### Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October . ### The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations . ### In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to . ### One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life . ### But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S . ### Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama . ### One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble . ### The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . ### In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . ### Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . ### Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups . ### The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action . ### However , last week Mr. Webster 's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in Panama . ### Nevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president . ### The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders . ### The new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed . ### Gerald F.

Levin was named vice president and chief economist of this commodity futures and options exchange . ### He had been associate professor in the department of finance at Seton Hall University . ### SIERRA TUCSON Cos. said it completed its initial public offering of 2.5 million common shares , which raised $ 30 million . ### The Tucson , Ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers said proceeds will be used for expansion , to pay debt and for general corporate purposes . ### Oppenheimer & Co. was the lead underwriter . ### The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation . ### The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . ### But inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter . ### `` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago . ### `` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added . ### The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate . ### Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels . ### Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession . ### In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter . ### The recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported . ### `` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington . ### The economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa . ### On the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . '' ### His estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate . ### Demand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production . ### By and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions . ### Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . ### Gary Ciminero , economist at Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior . ### He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures . ### Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports . ### The consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption . ### In August , personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % . ### Charles Lieberman , managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. , New York , said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism . ### Durable goods orders for September , due out tomorrow , are expected to show a slip of 1 % , compared with August 's 3.9 % increase . ### As usual , estimates on the fickle report are wide , running from a drop of 3.5 % to a gain of 1.6 % . ### HASTINGS MANUFACTURING Co. declared a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share and an extra dividend of five cents a share on its common stock , payable Dec. 15 to shares of record Nov. 17 . ### This is the 11th consecutive quarter in which the company has paid shareholders an extra dividend of five cents . ### The Hastings , Mich. , concern makes piston rings , filters and fuel pumps . ### Vickers PLC , a United Kingdom defense and engineering company , said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 % the previous week . ### I.E.P. Securities Ltd. , a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity -LRB- Pacific -RRB- Ltd. , boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares . ### The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months . ### In May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year . ### `` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman said . ### The spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company . ### Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses . ### When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants . ### `` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . ### Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials . ### It was a gutsy move for a little-known executive , fired after only two months as president of his previous company . ### But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson . ### Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive Swede quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us . ### If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . '' ### Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet . ### Characteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started . ### On Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange . ### At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 386 million -RRB- to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say . ### The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares . ### But that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say . ### Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 -LRB- $ 4.48 -RRB- to SKr205 -LRB- $ 31.65 -RRB- in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm . ### Tuesday , the shares regained SKr20 , closing at SKr225 . ### Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down Trelleborg 's share price . ### Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units . ### The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent . ### A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding . ### But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % . ### That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding . ### That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years . ### Most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers . ### Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux , Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results . ### The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns . ### Between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold . ### Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year . ### But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . '' ### Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . ### Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . ### `` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . ### `` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . '' ### But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles . ### Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . '' ### Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier . ### But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth . ### Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business . ### Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture . ### Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid . ### Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf . ### Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up . ### Falconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form . ### `` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company . ### But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president says . ### Perhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries . ### `` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says . ### `` The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says . ### `` That 's beginning to change . ### And investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses Trelleborg is in . ### Apple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a $ 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc . ### Excluding the gain , the company registered a modest 4.6 % increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to $ 113 million , or 87 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 107.9 million , or 84 cents a share . ### Proceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share . ### Apple shares fell 75 cents in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 48 a share . ### Fiscal fourth-quarter sales grew about 18 % to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.17 billion a year earlier . ### Without the Adobe gain , Apple 's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5 % to $ 406 million , or $ 3.16 a share , from $ 400.3 million , or $ 3.08 a share . ### Including the Adobe gain , full-year net was $ 454 million , or $ 3.53 a share . ### Sales for the year rose nearly 30 % to $ 5.28 billion from $ 4.07 billion a year earlier . ### John Sculley , chairman and chief executive officer , credited the Macintosh and IIcx computers , introduced in the winter , for the brightened sales performance . ### Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins , which dogged the company through most of 1989 , began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased . ### `` Adverse pressure on gross margins... has subsided , '' Mr. Sculley said . ### Margins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up , rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier . ### For all of fiscal 1989 , however , the average gross margin was 49 % , below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 % . ### Lower component costs -- especially for DRAMs , or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company , a spokeswoman said . ### Looking ahead to 1990 , Mr. Sculley predicted `` another year of significant revenue growth , '' along with improved profitability , as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990 . ### Gary J. Schantz , 44 years old , was named president and chief operating officer . ### Polymerix makes lumber-like materials that it describes as `` plastic wood . '' ### The operating chief 's post is new . ### Martin Schrager , 51 , who had been president , was named vice chairman . ### He remains chief executive officer . ### Mr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp . ### Separately , the board expanded to six members with the election of David L. Holewinski , a consultant . ### The company also said it privately placed stock and warrants in exchange for $ 750,000 . ### Terry L. Haines , formerly general manager of Canadian operations , was elected to the new position of vice president , North American sales , of this plastics concern . ### Also , Larry A. Kushkin , executive vice president , North American operations , was named head of the company 's international automotive operations , another new position . ### He remains an executive vice president , the company said , and his new position reflects `` the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman 's high performance plastic materials . '' ### Gordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations , and Mr. Kushkin 's former position is n't being filled at this time , the company said . ### General Electric Co. said it signed a contract with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $ 400 million power plant , which is being built in Burrillville , R.I . ### GE , along with a division of Ebasco , a subsidiary of Enserch Corp. , have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project , which they expect to complete in late 1990 . ### The second portion will be completed the following year . ### GE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion . ### The Environmental Protection Agency is getting a lot out of the Superfund program . ### Of the $ 4.4 billion spent so far on the program , 60 % is going for administrative costs , management and research , the Office of Technology Assessment just reported . ### Only 36 of 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been `` decontaminated . '' ### Over the next 50 years , $ 500 billion is earmarked for the program . ### At current allocations , that means EPA will be spending $ 300 billion on itself . ### It may not be toxic , but we know where one waste dump is . ### Chambers Development Co. said its Security Bureau Inc. unit purchased two security concerns in Florida that will add $ 2.1 million of annual revenue . ### Purchase of the businesses serving Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach , Fla. , is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry . ### Terms were n't disclosed . ### Basf AG said it moved its headquarters for Latin America to Mexico and the headquarters for the regional division to Singapore , effective Oct . ### The central offices for both regions were previously located in Ludwigshafen , Basf headquarters . ### The West German chemical concern called the moves a further step in the internationalization of its business activities . ### Both regions are the fastest-growing areas for Basf , the company said . ### David H. Eisenberg , 53 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Imasco 's 500-store Peoples Drug Stores Inc. unit , based in Alexandria , Va . ### Mr. Eisenberg was senior executive vice president and chief operating officer . ### Imasco is a tobacco , retailing , restaurant and financial services concern . ### Lotus Development Corp. is in talks to sell its Signal stock-quote service to Infotechnology Inc. , the New York parent of Financial News Network , people familiar with the negotiations said . ### They said the price would be around $ 10 million . ### Signal , which has an estimated 10,000 subscribers and is profitable , provides stock quotes over an FM radio band that can be received by specially equipped personal computers . ### The computers will display stock prices selected by users . ### Lotus , Cambridge , Mass. , has been rumored to have the sale of the four-year-old unit under consideration for a year . ### The business is n't related to Lotus 's main businesses of making computer software and publishing information on compact disks . ### `` Please submit your offers , '' says Felipe Bince Jr . ### He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill . ### The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million . ### Not a peso is offered . ### Mr. Bince , the trust 's associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure . ### `` It 's getting harder to sell , '' he mutters as he leaves the room . ### Indeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant . ### Of the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece . ### In October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos . ### Two years later , Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled . ### October is a critical month for the privatization program . ### Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged . ### In addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization . '' ### All told , there are assets on the line valued at up to $ 1.03 billion . ### The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds . ### Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program . ### But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments . ### Most recently , a lack of buyers has been added to the list . ### Rather than gathering momentum , the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets . ### The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset , the harder the privatization process . ### `` You just do n't see a whole lot happening , '' says an international economist . ### To be sure , the program has n't completely stalled . ### The Asset Privatization Trust , the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties , has recorded sales of more than $ 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 . ### But its success has been largely in the sale of small , nonperforming companies , which are valued for their assets . ### Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again . ### Ramon Garcia , the Asset Trust 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks . '' ### In light of the poor results recently , he says , the agency is adopting an `` attitude of flexibility . '' ### October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank , Associated Bank , for the minimum price of 671 million pesos -LRB- $ 31 million -RRB- . ### At the end of the month , the agency again will offer the bank . ### But instead of a minimum price , only a target price will be established . ### Bankers say , however , that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price . ### The bank has a negative net worth , they say . ### In addition , special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner , Leonardo Ty , the right to match the highest bid . ### Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution . ### In 1983 , the loans were converted into equity , giving Manila 98 % of the bank , but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights . ### His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers . ### Separately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines , or Picop , as the paper mill is known . ### The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market . ### But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n't the only consideration . ### As it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold . ### -LRB- About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . -RRB- ### Potential buyers , mostly foreign companies , are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that , by the government 's own reckoning , needs some $ 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation . ### The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say . ### Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer . ### Under government regulations , however , foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % . ### Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners . ### A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale . ### Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . ### The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . ### The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed . ### This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors , increasing board membership to nine . ### The new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger , president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. , and Peter S. Willmott , chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc . ### Gerard E. Wood , 51 years old , was elected president , chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company . ### He succeeds Harry A. Durney , 65 , who is retiring from active duty but remains a director and consultant . ### Mr. Wood has been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc . ### Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. , two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction . ### The new holding company , Bancorp Inc. , will have about $ 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut . ### Tangible capital will be about $ 115 million . ### The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement . ### In the merger , each share of Webster , based in Waterbury , will be converted into one share of the new company . ### Each share of Eagle , based in Bristol , will become 0.95 share of . ### In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to $ 11 . ### In national over-the-counter trading , Webster shares fell 25 cents to $ 12.375 . ### Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million . ### Their indicated market values thus are about $ 43.3 million and $ 28.6 million , respectively . ### Frank J. Pascale , chairman of Eagle , will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith , president and chief executive officer of Webster , will take those posts at . ### Harold W. Smith Sr. , chairman of Webster , will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company . ### Ralph T. Linsley , vice chairman of Eagle , will become vice chairman of . ### The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company . ### In an interview , James Smith said the banks ' `` markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative . ### '' Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding , he said . ### At June 30 , Webster , which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury , had assets of $ 699 million . ### Eagle , which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington , had assets of $ 469.6 million on that date . ### Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well . ### The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries . ### Having said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case . ### It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . ### In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . ### How can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ? ### -LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB- ### Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 -LCB- state enterprises -RCB- currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 . ### '' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure . ### I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint . ### Those enterprises , however , are not going to be privatized . ### They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution . ### In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy . . . . '' ### Yet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . '' ### The bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform . ### A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without having to answer to the public . ### To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability . ### Daniel James President Mexico-United States Institute ### The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . ### The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results this week . ### Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 . ### A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according to people familiar with the group . ### The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . ### But to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today . ### Instead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction . ### People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out . ### In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , UAL closed at $ 168.50 a share , down $ 21.625 . ### But the pilots union , which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air . ### Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained . ### After the collapse of the last effort , the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed . ### Under the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders . ### Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company . ### For example , the group could offer $ 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share . ### UAL currently has 22.6 million shares , fully diluted . ### The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest . ### The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control . ### The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % . ### It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % . ### Management 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air . ### One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period . ### Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time . ### The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale . ### The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board . ### However , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse . ### Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp . ### Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid . ### But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . ### On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . '' ### However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . ### Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer . ### But the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor . ### One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid . ### Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing , chief financial officer John Pope , may come under pressure to resign . ### However , people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time . ### Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison . ### Whittle Communications Limited Partnership , Knoxville , Tenn. , will launch its first media property targeting Hispanic women . ### `` La Familia de Hoy , '' or `` Today 's Family , '' will debut this spring and will combine a national bimonthly magazine and TV programming . ### The television element of `` La Familia '' includes a series of two-minute informational features to air seven days a week on the Spanish-language Univision network , a unit of Univision Holdings Inc. , which is 80%-owned by Hallmark Cards Inc . ### The features will focus on `` parenting , family health and nutrition , and financial management , '' and will carry 30 seconds of advertising . ### The magazines , also ad-supported , will be distributed in more than 10,000 doctors ' offices , clinics , and health centers in Hispanic and largely Hispanic communities . ### WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp . ### The 10 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . ### Weirton , of Weirton , W.

'' ### Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker . ### But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either . ### According to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies . ### Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media . ### On Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer . ### The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost . ### `` It was quite a shock , '' says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper . ### `` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . '' ### Other changes , including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected . ### But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans , who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz . ### And that 's a problem . ### Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . ### `` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . ### `` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' ### Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . ### Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . ### Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . ### He was later shown on television , fielding questions . ### At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies . ### The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . '' ### The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies . ### This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . ### Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . '' ### Rep. Ronnie Flippo -LRB- D. , Ala. -RRB- , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change . ### `` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . ### But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz . ### Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus . ### He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. Honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent . ### Barbara Donovan , an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich , says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer . ### Even if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo . ### Against this background , the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing . ### The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 . ### `` He does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin . ### `` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . '' ### The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him . ### The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations . ### And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man . ### For average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle . ### `` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a 30-year-old East German doctor . ### `` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' ### The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning . ### The walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition . ### `` I have to come here to read the walls , '' says the doctor , `` because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers . '' ### Meanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor . ### Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production . ### East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own . ### His point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes . ### `` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the East Berlin shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it . ### The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing . ### But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms . ### New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures . ### The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society , the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments . ### The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research . ### Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end . ### This was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May , at the height of the controversy , when more than 1,500 scientists , along with scores of reporters and TV crews , crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject . ### Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons , were at the meeting . ### But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience . ### The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research . ### Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons . ### The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium . ### When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate . ### Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy . ### But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat . ### The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in , they reported . ### Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod . ### As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely . ### One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani , professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota . ### Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results . ### But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat . ### `` The results were fascinating , '' he said . ### On the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat . ### The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument . ### When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said . ### Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' ### It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . ### The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . ### Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested . ### `` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said . ### Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . ### The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . ### One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . ### One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements . ### Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt . ### One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells . ### A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it , reported Turgut M. Gur , an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins , head of the Stanford experimental team . ### One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University . ### Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water . ### He said that within the past few days , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium . ### There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon . ### Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons , which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions , continue to be negative . ### Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable . ### Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays . ### A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event . ### Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it . ### In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . ### They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment . ### At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory . ### Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990 . ### The rates , which take effect Jan. 2 , include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising . ### The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts . ### The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 . ### `` Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up , '' said Peter R.

'' ### Advertising rates for the Eastern , Midwest , Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5 % , and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5 % . ### Rates for the Wall Street Journal Reports will remain unchanged . ### A one-time noncontract full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal national edition will cost $ 99,385 . ### Advertising rates for The Wall Street , published in Brussels and printed in the Netherlands and Switzerland , will increase 9 % . ### Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal , published and printed in Hong Kong and also printed in Singapore and Tokyo , will rise 8 % . ### Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly , published in New York for North American readers , will rise 6 % . ### Dow Jones also publishes Barron 's magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services . ### It owns 67 % of Telerate Inc. , a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets . ### Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending , Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier . ### Net fell to $ 65 million , or 67 cents a common share , from $ 93.7 million or $ 1.03 a share , a year ago . ### Sales fell 2.5 % to $ 1.54 billion from $ 1.58 billion . ### For the nine months , the electronics and defense concern had net of $ 255.8 million , or $ 2.70 a share , down 5.6 % from $ 271 million , or $ 3.01 a share , in the year-ago period . ### Sales were $ 4.66 billion , up 1.3 % from $ 4.6 billion . ### Jerry Junkins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors . ### That , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit . ### In addition , cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net . ### However , the quarter results included $ 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses , up from $ 21 million in the year-earlier period . ### The nine months include $ 125 million of royalty income , up from $ 98 million last year . ### Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook , hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed . ### `` We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market , '' he said , `` and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand . '' ### Further , he said , an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount . ### Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $ 20 million plus assumption of $ 24 million of debt . ### Western New Mexico Telephone , Silver City , had net income of $ 1.9 million on revenue of about $ 10 million last year . ### It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico . ### It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico . ### The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business . ### The company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass-making and food-processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry . ### Nelson Bunker Hunt on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal . ### Silver , now trading around $ 5 an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 . ### `` Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , '' says Lesley Edgar , managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. , London bullion brokers . ### While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says . ### Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . ### Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes . ### Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say . ### Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . ### Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . ### Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . ### Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . ### Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s . ### `` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says Frederick R. Demler , analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . ### A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. , he says . ### Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . ### Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . ### Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he says . ### Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . ### Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says . ### Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years , improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range . ### `` There 's just too much silver around , '' says Tom Butler , an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. , a London bullion house . ### A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report . ### This year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says Rhona O'Connell , London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton . ### `` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. O'Connell says . ### Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say . ### Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says Urs Seiler , senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland . ### Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says . ### However , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most . ### Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots . ### After the close of trading Friday , the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 , down 6 % from that date a year earlier . ### Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline . ### Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef . ### The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter . ### Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter . ### In the 1988 quarter , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches . ### The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable . ### A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy . ### The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter , which was in line with projections by analysts . ### Energy Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $ 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange . ### Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board . ### Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions . ### Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm . ### Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . ### For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . ### Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . ### On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . ### In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force . ### The mine is expected to return to production in about a week . ### On Friday , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in London , which takes place at noon EDT . ### The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper . ### Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound . ### A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . ### That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . ### `` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm . ### But whether this price break has implications for this week , he said , `` we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning . '' ### Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . ### Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . ### He also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . ### Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound . ### Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other . ### Called Task Broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together . ### If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . ### It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . ### Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast . ### The new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . '' ### In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed . ### With the Hewlett-Packard program , he said , `` You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . '' ### The program , which will be shipped in January 1990 , runs on the Unix operating system . ### Hewlett-Packard will charge $ 5,000 for a license covering 10 users . ### The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn . ### Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines . ### The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . ### A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing . ### But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system . ### Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work . ### The Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group . ### Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . ### `` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . ### As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . ### The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . ### The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain . ### Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower . ### And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' ### Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum . ### But early this year , PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says John Rohs , an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co . ### That brought a chain reaction in the industry . ### The situation was further aggravated early this month , when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons . ### It also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test-marketing . ### Now , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high . ### The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before . ### The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less . ### Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . ### `` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . ### Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' ### With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' ### If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest . ### `` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says . ### `` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . '' ### The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available . ### With the market so crowded , says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus , Ohio , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . '' ### Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow . ### According to Mr. Rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 , except for August . ### `` McDonald 's has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says . ### Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations . ### Jack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales . ### He adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . '' ### Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. Greenberg . ### Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s , he adds . ### But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers . ### Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict . ### Big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. Harty , the Burger King operator in New York . ### The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . ### Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers . ### Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting . ### But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . ### He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing . ### In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions . ### Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise . ### Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . ### The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . ### Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . ### The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . ### Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate . ### Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . ### The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . ### Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . ### The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . ### Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate . ### CalMat Co. said it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million . ### CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand . ### And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit . ### Reggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . ### Mr. Jackson , who won the nickname `` Mr. October '' for his World Series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each . ### Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual . ### `` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says Jack Smalling , a dealer in Ames , Iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs . ### An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend . ### Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well . ### `` For someone who has everything else -- Reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says William Vizas , owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver , who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show . ### For years , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold . ### But these players were dead . ### `` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks , '' says Mr. Smalling . ### However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way . ### `` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif . ### `` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? '' ### And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now . ### `` I do n't think the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he says . ### Why Mr. Jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . ### He probably has n't done it for the cash . ### `` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says Matt Merola , an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York . ### `` He has good investments . '' ### And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too . ### Or at least he should . ### `` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. Smalling , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks . ### `` I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers . ### USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market . ### Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons . ### The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies . ### Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel . ### The surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand . ### They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in . ### `` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . ### `` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . '' ### He does add , however , that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel . ### That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet . ### The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees . ### Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . ### For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . ### USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . ### USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . ### Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . ### The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines . ### Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel . ### One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly . ### ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ? ### You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . '' ### Dream on . ### There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing . ### So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges . ### Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order . ### And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . ### Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions . ### With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' ### It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . '' ### For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price . ### A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . ### Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . ### Limit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . ### Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . ### Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 . ### A limit order to sell could be entered at that price . ### One risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls . ### Unless the market goes at least one tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price . ### Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . ### Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . ### Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses . ### While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above . ### In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below . ### The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . ### An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday . ### Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . ### Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . ### If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled . ### Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled . ### But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price . ### Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached . ### However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it . ### As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price . ### Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . ### It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . ### But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled . ### Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . ### `` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says . ### `` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . '' ### Not-Held Order : This is another timing order . ### It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting . ### Not-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk . ### One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order . ### In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security . ### Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time . ### `` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders . ### For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . ### `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . ### `` Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . ### Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . ### On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them . ### They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel . ### It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed . ### Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences . ### Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal . ### IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . '' ### But investors better not ignore its limitations , either . ### Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund . ### For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall . ### Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret . ### The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 . ### So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on . ### Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . ### Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market . ### Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations . ### `` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure . ### `` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . '' ### In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock . ### That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio . ### Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer . ### In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired . ### Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide . ### `` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago-based group . ### `` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements . ### READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ? ### First , a pop quiz . ### When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ? ### Pencils down . ### If you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding . ### `` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells . ### But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others . ### This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . ### Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . ### U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity . ### But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . ### Risk is also a function of time . ### When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns . ### Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider . ### That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time . ### But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals . ### For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings . ### But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods . ### By retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement . ### `` That 's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives , '' says Steven B. Enright , a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services . ### As a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios . ### They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year . ### They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals . ### And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified . ### The portfolios of two hypothetical families , one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 , illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider . ### For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk . ### But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk . ### The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue . ### Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman . ### That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings . ### But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio . ### -LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it . ### Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation . ### In two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate . ### Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range . ### There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range . -RRB- ### Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals . ### Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans . ### `` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington . ### `` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . '' ### Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . ### When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way . ### Looking to the past can provide some clues . ### Over several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills . ### But while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself . ### For instance , some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market . ### And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past. income . ### Portfolio A : Retired couple , age 65 ; $ 400,000 portfolio . ### Portfolio B : Two-income couple , age 45 ; $ 150,000 portfolio . ### A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega . ### He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup . ### Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise . ### It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners . ### The Sandinistas of Nicaragua , for example , also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus . ### In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition , Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap . ### We were wrong . ### THROUGHOUT THE 1980s , investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning . ### Capital has been democratized , and people want in . ### Too often , however , small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists . ### Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit This is particularly good news for those who hate risk , who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way . ### You know who you are . ### My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion . ### Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity , I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only to assuage my father-in-law , who believes in such things . ### So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market . ### Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative . ### Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 -RRB- . ### Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery . ### Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment . ### By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it . '' ### Concerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health . ### Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . ### Disgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it . ### Bank it ? ### Not really Sock it away in long-term instruments ? ### Nonsense Daily living is the best possible investment ### Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all . ### All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential . ### At least , according to my calculations . ### Personal space -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade , a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles , which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day . ### The assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms -LRB- Figure 4 -RRB- has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for my record collection , whose worth , I think it 's safe to say , is incalculable . ### Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB- , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . ### According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- , where I plan to offer it shortly . ### Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale . ### I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . ### My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations . ### At the same time , my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning . ### Over the course of the decade , for instance , my return on investment in the area of poker alone -LRB- Figures 7A and 7B -RRB- has been most impressive , showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way my associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond . ### With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage . ### My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it . ### But with every step I take , I 'm building wealth . ### You can , too , if you , like me , refuse to bite the bullet . ### So go out there and eat that debt . ### You 're right there in the mainstream of American business , building value on the back of insupportable expenditures . ### Henry Kravis , watch out ### Mr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York . ### WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice . ### `` He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great , '' recalls Mr. Schwartz , now 40 . ### He tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers . ### Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning . ### It should be noted that Mr. Schwartz , who operates out of Englewood , Colo. , is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle . ### But in this case the needle has a very sharp point . ### Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` anybody who can fog a mirror '' can call himself a financial planner . ### Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars , but in effect they operate in the dark . ### There is no effective regulation of planners , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks -- a dog got into one trade group -- no way to assess their performance , no way even to know how many of them there are -LRB- estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 -RRB- . ### All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning . ### So it should come as no shock that the profession , if that 's what it is , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money . ### Alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners . ### Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards , too ; they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine . ### But reform has n't taken hold yet . ### `` The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days , '' says Scott Stapf , director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association . ### An admittedly limited survey by NASAA , whose members are state securities-law regulators , found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million . ### The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother . ### What 's more , the losses they and the others caused `` are just what we are stumbling over , '' says Mr. Stapf , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected . ### So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners . ### Nobody can estimate the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery . ### His group , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners . ### Surveying all this , some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all . ### For most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says Barbara Roper , who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America , a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington . ### She concedes that such a position is `` unfair '' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade , but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it . ### She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps `` were still getting ripped off . '' ### The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning . ### The Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business . ### But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners -LRB- IAFP -RRB- , the industry 's biggest trade group , is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 , and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well . ### An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous . ### A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months . ### The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate . ### Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity . ### The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade . ### Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years . ### A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years . ### `` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem , '' says Kathryn McGrath , director of the SEC 's division of investment management . ### So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business . ### Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules . ### The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with . ### Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . '' ### Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff . ### -LRB- Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization . ### When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded . ### That may be because Mr. Gargan , smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group , enrolled his dog , Beauregard , as a member of the IAFP . ### Then he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership -- it was made out to `` Boris ` Bo ' Regaard '' -- to every newspaper he could think of . ### The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification . ### NASAA , the organization of state securities regulators , is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states . ### It requires financial planners to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest . ### The most common conflict involves compensation . ### NASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend . ### The issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ? ### In 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. , an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors . ### In its notice of action , the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the attorney general alleged , the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos . ### Those investments paid big commissions to First Meridian , payments investors were never told about , the attorney general alleged . ### Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted . ### In practice , the attorney general alleged in an affidavit , if an investor had access to cash `` the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club . '' ### And , the attorney general added , First Meridian 's president , Roger V. Sala , portrayed himself as a `` financial expert '' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth . ### First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general . ### Harry Manion , Mr. Sala 's attorney , says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect . ### As for Mr. Sala 's qualifications , `` the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree , '' says Mr. Manion . ### Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common . ### Two such actions , both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta , could be particularly embarrassing to the industry : both name J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP , as defendant . ### One suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . ### Those companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . ### The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . ### One plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . ### In affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned . ### Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors . ### Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots , he opened up his briefcase and dumped $ 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors , says Myron Diebel , the bank 's president . ### `` He said he wanted to show the color of his money , '' recalls Mr. Diebel . ### Bank officials , however , showed him the door , and the sale never came off . ### According to the suit , Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment . ### They want it back . ### Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits , saying he prefers to save such responses for court . ### But he does say that all of his activities have been `` entirely proper . '' ### On the suit by the limited partners , he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs . ### The suit , he adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people . '' ### Rearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths . '' ### He declines to go into specifics . ### Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which people generally are more prone to sue . ### `` I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation , '' he says . ### Mr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore . ### He now calls himself an `` investment banker . '' ### In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way . ### Using it , would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner ? ### Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . ### Certificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner . ### Now they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County . ### CDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing `` bank '' in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too . ### And the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $ 100 ? ### Never mind . ### You already know the answer . ### Mr. Emshwiller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau . ### At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center , the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards . ### They root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire . ### They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court . ### They graze at the Farmers Market , a combination gourmet food court and grocery store , while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies . ### `` The beautiful look of wool , '' croons the show 's narrator , `` slightly Victorian in its influence ... . '' ### Meanwhile , in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island , the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced . ### Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time , a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here . ### `` They seem to like these industrial parks , '' says Kacy McClelland , a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud . ### `` We call them fraud farms . '' ### Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach . ### This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents . ### It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' . ### How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes ? ### Clearly , the existence of the former lures the latter . ### The places renowned for breeding bunco , like the Miami neighborhood known as the `` Maggot Mile '' and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast cars , high rollers , glamorous women and lots of sunshine . ### You do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo . ### Con men hate snow . ### Newport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly . ### What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for ? ### Nothing seems hard here . ### The breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily . ### Nightlife is plentiful . ### Moreover , ostentation is appreciated . ### The median price of homes is $ 547,000 ; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor . ### `` Blondes , cocaine and Corvettes , '' mutters Mr. McClelland . ### `` That 's what they 're after . '' ### The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . ### `` One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force . ### `` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people . '' ### No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders . ### But above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish . ### Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest . ### `` I 've heard that there is $ 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year , '' Mr. McClelland says . ### `` If that 's true , Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that . '' ### And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles . ### In fact , sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as `` Newport Beach '' operations . ### That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as `` Hollywood '' scams . ### Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot . ### The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals . ### In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month . ### Thus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges . ### Douglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors . ### `` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. Jones says , `` but no intent to defraud . '' ### Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars . ### Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices . ### Indeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room . ### But , says Mr. Katz , the U.S. attorney , `` the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices , with plush furnishings . ### When we go there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . '' ### The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . ### Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . ### Mr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . ### With the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits . ### `` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says . ### All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element . ### Vincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project . ### Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable . ### '' -LRB- Investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent . -RRB- ### Richard Luehrs , president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce , calls boiler rooms a `` negative we wish we could get rid of . '' ### Actually , `` we do n't get much negative publicity about this , '' he insists , `` except for the press who write about it . '' ### Mr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal 's Dallas bureau . ### YOU WENT to college and thought you got an education . ### Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson : How to send your kids to college . ### True , when you went to college , there was n't that much to learn . ### Stick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow . ### Now , investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years . ### In short , throw away the passbook and go for the glory . ### The reason is cost . ### Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s . ### Tuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year ; that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period . ### A year at Harvard now goes for $ 19,395 . ### By 2007 , when this year 's newborns hit campus , a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost $ 300,000 , give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time . ### Stanford , MIT and other utmosts will cost no less . ### So what 's a parent to do ? ### Some investment advisers are suggesting , in effect , a bet on a start-up investment pool -- maybe even on margin . ### Others prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . ### Still others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? ### `` You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . ### To get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' ### In other words , a little volatility never hurt . ### It never hurt anyone , that is , unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to . ### Or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition . ### That 's the dilemma for today 's parent . ### Although many experts are advising risk , no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off . ### Help may be on the way . ### The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools . ### Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s . ### And then there 's always State U . ### But parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine . ### Belatedly aware of public concern , lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes . ### Their message , explicit or implicit , is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore . ### Forget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund . ### The latest wave of marketing is instructive . ### Several outfits -- including the Financial Programs , Franklin , and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house -- are advertising `` college planner '' tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly . ### The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually -- a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place , the stock market . ### Most of the mailers are free , but Denver-based Financial Programs sells , for $ 15 , a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice . ### The figures are shocking . ### To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age , parents would need to set aside $ 773.94 a month -- for 12 years . ### They can cut this to $ 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college . ### And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier -- when mother and child come home from the hospital . ### Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with . ### Using a recent average private-school cost of about $ 12,500 a year , T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes $ 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six . ### Since the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund , there would also be $ 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years . ### Not everyone is so pessimistic . ### `` People are basically peddling a lot of fear , '' says Arthur Hauptman , a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington . ### He takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . ### Still , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . `` ### The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says . ### `` That 's crazy . '' ### His advice : Do n't panic . ### Parents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford . ### Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds . ### That way , parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition . ### Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages . ### He favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds . ### In their anxiety , however , parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes . ### They have laid out about $ 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by Connecticut , Illinois , Virginia and eight other states . ### And they have bought about $ 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans , offered in Michigan , Florida and Wyoming . ### The prepaid plans take payment today -- usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount -- for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow . ### The baccalaureate bonds -- tax-free , offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity -- seem to be tailor-made for college savers . ### Like other zeros , they pay all their interest at maturity , meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school . ### Their compounding effect is also alluring . ### In June , Virginia sold bonds for $ 268.98 that will pay $ 1,000 in 2009 . ### But Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , says zeros are particularly ill-suited . ### Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . ### That wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal . ### Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures . ### Most other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better . ### The prepaid plans may be a good bet , provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure . ### Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions , however , and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools . ### Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable . ### Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan . ### The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee . ### Prepayments , much like mutual-fund purchases , are pooled for investment . ### Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns . ### But buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so . ### One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable . ### The colleges , as educational institutions , had hoped that would n't be the case . ### Based on historical rates of return , Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio , indexed to the market , would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century . ### But sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . ### And they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . ### `` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work , '' says Mr. Anderson . ### What happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? ### Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack . ### Not so Michigan . ### Its plan is set up as an independent agency . ### The state says there 's no worry -- investment returns , combined with fees and the gains from unused plans , will provide all the cash it needs . ### Mr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau . ### If you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 , 1990 , here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale , Notre Dame and University of Minnesota . ### Figures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition , fees , room and board and an 8 % annual investment return . ### Note : These figures are only for mandatory charges and do n't include books , transportation etc . ### For in-state students ### Source : PaineWebber Inc . ### AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising . ### He sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds , and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he `` live-hauled '' to market along with his own whiskery crop . ### And he nearly always bought and sold for cash . ### Along the way , Mr. Tharp omitted a total of $ 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years . ### The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator , Samuel James Baker . ### Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers , live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by Mr. Tharp and others . ### Unknown to Mr. Tharp , he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes . ### Confronted with the evidence , Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison . ### He also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties . ### A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think . ### Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions . ### Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off . ### Mail-order ministers have been squelched . ### Now , television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny . ### The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return . ### IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners . ### Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , the IRS has said . ### Once such abuses become so pervasive , the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them . ### San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because IRS agents envy their life styles . ### Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them . ### Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals . ### And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers . ### Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony -LRB- who gets a deduction -RRB- must report the former spouse 's Social Security number . ### Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers , enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns . ### But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention . ### In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses . ### The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination . ### Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like . ### The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes . ### Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax . ### And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased . ### Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back . ### It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says . ### The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business . ### The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields . ### For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 . ### The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it . ### The Direct Selling Association , a trade group , points out that its members , which include Amway Corp. , cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject . ### The independent-contractor project , which began in 1988 , involves about 350 IRS agents . ### In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports Raymond P. Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors . ### The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , mostly paid by small firms . ### Many workers , especially professionals , want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't . ### But many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for the IRS , says Jerry Lackey , who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando . ### Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't , he says . ### In his area , Mr. Lackey continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work . ### But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors . ### The IRS assessed the clinic $ 350,000 in back payroll taxes . ### It assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents . ### Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . ### The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . ### Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . ### The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . ### Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . ### The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . ### In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident . ### `` We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project , '' Mr. Hicks declares . ### Mr. Schmedel is editor of The Wall Street Journal 's Tax Report column . ### In finding `` good news '' in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan -LRB- `` The Privileged Class , '' editorial , Sept. 20 -RRB- , you 're reading the headline but not the story . ### The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria . ### But that does n't mean `` half of the students attending Berkeley '' will be admitted this way . ### The plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll . ### Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class . ### In addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category . ### But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , English-language proficiency and an essay . ### This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants . ### The plan thus will decrease by 22 % , for a net loss of 10 % , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria . ### Who will take over these places ? ### The plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives about 10 % of the class . ### One of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race . ### Perhaps it does . ### But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences . ### Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action `` target '' for their group . ### The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race . ### The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result . ### Stephen R. Barnett Professor of Law University of California Berkeley , Calif . ### FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others , read on . ### This is a story about suckers . ### Most of us know a sucker . ### Many of us are suckers . ### But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker . ### What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of ? ### Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner ? ### What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ? ### Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off , once it is built ? ### Because in the end , these people always wind up asking themselves the same question : `` How could I be so stupid ? '' ### There are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them . ### `` These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick , '' says Kent Neal , chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a major haven for boiler rooms . ### `` Once they size them up , then they know what buttons to push . ### John Blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know . ### He used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins . ### `` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he says . ### The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns . ### `` We 're all a little greedy . ### Everyone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami . ### `` These guys prey on human frailties . '' ### While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore . ### `` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville . ### `` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . '' ### Adds Spencer Barasch , branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth , Texas : `` Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them ? ### People are shooting for a dream . '' ### Clearly , though , scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions ; the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy . ### There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd . ### So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . ### Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors . ### The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . ### Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged . ### Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' ### At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . ### In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . ### It also adds to the mystery of the venture . ### Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement . ### `` Once people got into it , I was allowing them to live a dream , '' he says . ### He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says . ### `` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . '' ### -LRB- Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation . ### He says he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . -RRB- ### For some investors , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived . ### `` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard . ### Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . ### `` People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says . ### Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery . ### But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy . ### When he visited the company 's office , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . '' ### Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division . ### Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches . ### But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children . ### Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud . ### Scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves . ### For instance , salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your family ? '' ### Or an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told , `` You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind . '' ### Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them . ### William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed . ### The Lyneses , of Powder Springs , Ga. , have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James , alleging fraud . ### They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding . ### They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently . ### He urged them to refer their friends , who also lost money . ### -LRB- Donald Trinen , an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm , denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment . -RRB- ### `` It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients , '' says Terree Bowers , chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles . `` We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling . ### Anything to make a sale . '' ### Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point , timing is crucial . ### People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives . ### `` Sometimes when people are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm . ### `` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . '' ### They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money-retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses . ### `` These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive . ### Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles . ### Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him . ### Mr. Cortese , a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer , invested some $ 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns . ### `` We were saving up to buy a house , and my wife was pregnant , '' says Mr. Cortese . ### `` It was just before the Christmas holidays , and I figured we could use some extra cash . '' ### The investment is worth about $ 130 today . ### `` Maybe it was just a vulnerable time , '' says Mr. Cortese . ### `` Maybe the next day or even an hour later , I would n't have done it . '' ### Ms. Brannigan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Atlanta bureau . ### Prices for seats on the New York Stock Exchange are recovering a bit after hitting a four-year low earlier this month . ### Two seats on the Big Board were sold yesterday for $ 455,000 , and then $ 500,000 . ### The previous sale was $ 436,000 on Oct. 17 ; the last time prices were that low was November 1985 , when a seat sold for $ 425,000 . ### Prices peaked at $ 1,150,000 in September 1987 . ### Seats are currently quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked . ### FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at least it 's exercise . ### At least it has a little dash . ### Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , drab duties rather than pleasures . ### Like trying to buy life insurance , for instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash . ### Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible . ### But sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work . ### And my time has come . ### I 'm 33 , married , no children , and employed in writing stories like this one . ### In times past , life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it . ### So if anything happened to me , I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts -LRB- though not , I admit , enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury -RRB- . ### Figuring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish . ### Over the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations . ### Besides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on . ### What to do ? ### First , generalize . ### Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive . ### If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits . ### It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age . ### But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires . ### It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it . ### Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older . ### So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . ### There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others . ### One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders . ### Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense . ### Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years . ### Sounds great -- or does it ? ### First , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration . ### Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit . ### Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile . ### That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me . ### Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing . ### And the Second Law , unique to insurance ? ### If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins . ### This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value . ### The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . ### The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature . ### That is gilding the lily . ### The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into . ### That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package . ### Again , no free lunch . ### This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection . ### And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this . ### So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment . ### The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy . ### You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years . ### One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment . ### Congress closed this loophole last year , or thought it did . ### However , Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences . ### But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small . ### I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life . ### Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life . ### I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy . ### In looking at these and other policies , I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years . ### They commonly give two scenarios : One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees -LRB- usually 4 % to 4.5 % -RRB- and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5 % or more . ### Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? ### Not likely , I think . ### Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . ### These are not certain , either . ### Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm . ### Another factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately . ### There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them . ### At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . '' ### I call her agent , David Dominici . ### Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . ### If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . ### I do n't like the sound of that . ### Some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is maintained for 10 years . ### But Glenn Daily , a New York-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the companies . ### And the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments . ### So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . ### Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive . ### Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants . ### But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance . ### Also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes . ### And considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it . ### I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even though it turns out to be low-load life . ### Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot . ### I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen . ### After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable . ### The difference is magnified by time , too . ### At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate . ### Did I buy it ? ### Well , not yet . ### I 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first . ### A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it . ### Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset sales , Robert Cawthorn , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said . ### His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents a share , compared with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents a share , a year ago . ### Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of `` somewhat less than 10 % . '' ### Through the first six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period . ### Growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter $ 269 million , compared with $ 244.6 million a year ago . ### Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . ### Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . ### Thrombinar , a drug used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . ### He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . ### As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said . ### Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 . ### He said the company is still looking for `` a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . '' ### Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 . ### He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 . ### `` We had underfunded Maalox for a year , '' he said , because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs . ### He said Rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period . ### A `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in the third quarter , he said . ### Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook . ### The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year . ### Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe , rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas , and declining demand . ### HomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary , Home Federal Savings & Loan , converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank . ### The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday , HomeFed said . ### The change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits , federal regulatory powers or company operations , a spokesman said . ### It was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash , but this time it was different . ### Stocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data that showed less inflation than expected . ### Blue chips led the march up in heavy trading . ### The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.55 points to 2683.20 . ### The 30 industrials led the market higher from the opening bell as foreign buyers stepped in . ### By afternoon , the broader market joined the advance in full strength . ### Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80 . ### New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares . ### The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon , but cautious investors took profits before the close . ### Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally . ### The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September , while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase . ### Stock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally 's momentum . ### The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express , while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar , analysts said . ### Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally , traders said . ### Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher . ### To the amazement of some traders , takeover stocks were climbing again . ### Hilton rose 2 to 100 , for example . ### Last Friday , takeover traders spilled out of Hilton , knocking the stock down 21 to 85 . ### Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so : Holiday Corp. gained 1 to 73 and Honeywell rose 2 to 81 . ### One floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that British Airways is n't making a special effort to revive the UAL buy-out . ### The announcement of the buy-out 's troubles triggered the market 's nose dive a week ago . ### Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $ 1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International . ### `` That 's put some oomph back into this market , '' said Peter VandenBerg , a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton . ### But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye . ### `` There is no strength behind this rally , '' asserted Chung Lew , head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America . ### `` It 's traders squaring positions . ### 's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall . '' ### Indeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices . ### The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday . ### The MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average . ### Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated . ### By Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today . ### `` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI positions , Mr. Selkin said . ### Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues . ### Philip Morris added 1 to 44 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares , Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 to 70 , Merck gained 1 to 77 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced to 43 on 2.5 million shares . ### American Medical jumped 1 to 23 . ### IMA Acquisition , an investor group that includes First Boston and the Pritzker family of Chicago , said Chemical Bank had made arrangements for 23 other banks to provide $ 509 million in bank financing for the buy-out offer . ### Chemical and six other banks , along with First Boston , are providing the rest of the $ 1.6 billion . ### Elsewhere on the takeover front , Time Warner advanced 2 to 136 and Warner Communications tacked on to 63 . ### The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed a ruling that barred Chris-Craft Industries from voting its Warner preferred stock as a separate class in deciding on the companies ' proposed merger . ### Paramount Communications climbed 1 to 58 1 to 64 ; both media companies have long been mentioned as potential acquisition candidates . ### Among other actual and rumored targets , Woolworth rose 1 to 60 1 , 1 to to . ### In addition : -- Soo Line jumped 2 to 20 , above the $ 19.50 a share that Canadian Pacific offered for the company in a takeover proposal . ### -- Xtra gained 1 to 27 . ### Investor Robert M. Gintel , who owns a 4.7 % stake in the company , said he plans a proxy fight for control of its board . ### -- Golden Nugget rose 2 to 28 . ### Its board approved the repurchase of as many as three million common shares , or about 17 % of its shares outstanding . ### Buying interest also resurfaced in the technology sector , including International Business Machines , whose board approved a $ 1 billion increase in its stock buy-back program . ### IBM rose 2 to 104 as 2.2 million shares changed hands . ### Compaq Computer soared 4 to 111 on 1.8 million shares in response to the company 's announcement of plans to introduce several products next month . ### Digital Equipment gained 1 to 89 despite reporting earnings for the September quarter that were on the low end of expectations . ### Among other technology issues , Cray Research rose 1 to 37 , Hewlett-Packard added 1 to 50 1 , to to . ### On the other hand , Symbol Technologies dropped 1 to 18 after Shearson Lehman Hutton lowered its short-term investment rating on the stock and its 1989 earnings estimate , and Commodore International fell to 8 after the company said it expects to post a loss for the September quarter . ### Insurance stocks continued to climb on expectations that premium rates will rise in the aftermath of the earthquake in the San Francisco area . ### American International Group climbed 4 to 106 , General Re rose 3 to 89 , Kemper added 2 to 48 , AON went up 1 to 36 and Chubb rose 1 to 82 . ### Stocks of major toy makers rallied in the wake of strong third-quarter earnings reports . ### Mattel added 1 to 19 , Tonka firmed 1 to 18 and Lewis Galoob Toys rose to 13 on the Big Board , while Hasbro gained 1 to 21 on the American Stock Exchange . ### Capital Cities-ABC surged 42 to 560 . ### Kidder Peabody raised its investment rating on the stock and its earnings estimates for 1989 and 1990 , based on optimism that the company 's ABC television network will continue to fare well in the ratings . ### Dun & Bradstreet lost 1 to 51 on 1.8 million shares . ### Merrill Lynch lowered its short-term rating on the stock and its estimate of 1990 earnings , citing a sales slowdown in the company 's credit-rating business . ### Pinnacle West Capital , which suspended its common-stock dividend indefinitely and reported a 91 % decline in third-quarter earnings , fell to 11 . ### The Amex Market Value Index recorded its sharpest gain of the year by climbing 4.74 to 382.81 . ### Volume totaled 14,580,000 shares . ### B.A.T Industries , the most active Amex issue , rose to 12 . ### The company received shareholder approval for its restructuring plan , designed to fend off a hostile takeover bid from a group headed by financier Sir James Goldsmith . ### Chambers Development Class A jumped 3 to 37 and Class B rose 2 to 37 . ### The company said six officers are buying a total of $ 1.5 million of its stock . ### TRC Cos. , the target of an investigation by the U.S. inspector general , dropped 2 to 10 . ### The probe involves testing procedures used on certain government contracts by the company 's Metatrace unit . ### Avondale Industries Inc. , New Orleans , received a $ 23 million contract from the Navy to enlarge by 50 % the capacity of an auxiliary oiler . ### The award results from the Navy 's exercising of an option in an earlier contract it awarded Avondale . ### Richard J. Pinola was elected to the board of this personnel consulting concern , increasing its size to nine members . ### Mr. Pinola is president and chief operating officer of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co . ### The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration . ### The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution . ### The vote , in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position , was a victory for Democratic leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights . ### `` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine . ### In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley -LRB- D. , Wash . -RRB- had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change . ### Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately . ### In June , the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration , saying he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by the First Amendment . ### If you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news . ### You 're probably right , and you are n't alone . ### A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression . ### The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies . ### It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members . ### The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group . ### In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial . ### Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation . ### In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression . ### He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims . ### `` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. Warshaw said . ### Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long . ### Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance . ### But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help . ### The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings . ### The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing . ### The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies . ### More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company . ### Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings . ### The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production . ### Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled . ### Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . '' ### He also noted that various work environments , such as night work , have their own `` stressors . '' ### `` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm . ### The problem , says Mr. D'Arcy , a psychologist , is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance . ### For Cheap Air Fares , Spend Christmas Aloft ### IT ISN'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free . ### But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America . ### In recent years , carriers have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap . ### But there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions . ### One of the best deals , though , may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives . ### This week , many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year , including Christmas . ### In recent years , the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares . ### That approach flopped : Last Christmas Day , a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh . ### So this year , the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts . ### They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 and 31 , and Jan. 4 , 5 and 6 . ### The promotions -- dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares -- put round-trip fares at $ 98 , $ 148 and $ 198 . ### `` They 're trying to keep planes flying on days they 'd normally park them , '' says Roger Bard , president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville , N.C . ### Expect , of course , sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel . ### Consider Adopting Your Spouse 's Name ### IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way , couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts . ### Continental , a Texas Air Corp. unit , recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights . ### The Continental catch : Only immediate family members are allowed , and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related . ### That irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name . ### `` What a bunch of nonsense , '' says Jessica Crosby , president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners . ### `` This sets things way back . '' ### Continental 's logic : It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related . ### `` We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate '' family affiliation with legal documents , says Jim O'Donnell , a senior vice president . ### But gay rights advocates are angry , too . ### The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family . ### `` It 's certainly discrimination , '' says attorney Evan Wolfson , whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members . ### Take Your Vacation ### In a Hurricane Area WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states , it downed electric and telephone lines , shot coconuts through cottage rooftops , shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives . ### It also lowered some air fares . ### Since the hurricane , Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines , a unit of AMR Corp. , trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to $ 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm . ### The fares are code-named Hugo , Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid . ### -LRB- Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake , but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips . -RRB- ### Some hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean promise money-back guarantees . ### In Myrtle Beach , S.C. , the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as $ 35 , or as much as 22 % below regular prices . ### Says Michele Hoffman , a clerk in the resort 's front office : `` We do n't have the outdoor pool , the pool table , ping pong table , snack bar or VCR , but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi . '' ### Just Wait Until You 're a Bit Older ### SENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares . ### This year , the older someone is the bigger the discount . ### A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare . ### Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age . ### And centenarians fly free in first class . ### Next month , Northwest Airlines says , a 108-year-old Lansing , Mich. , woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to Tampa , Fla . ### Last year when Northwest first offered the promotion , only six centenarians flew free . ### If All Else Fails . . . . ### THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers , retired military personnel and medical students . ### There 's even a special fare for clergy that does n't require the usual stay over Saturday night . ### That way , they can be home in time for work Sunday . ### The British Petroleum Co. PLC said its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea . ### In an official release , BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 . ### As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil . ### For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . ### But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates . ### Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax . ### Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn an additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 . ### Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit . ### Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments . ### We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill . ### Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill , it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor . ### The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors . ### Rep. J. Dennis Hastert -LRB- R. , Ill . -RRB- ### When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago , Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory . ### Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room . ### He also says he is losing money now . ### He blames imports . ### But just down Seventh Avenue , where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made , Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather . ### He credits imports . ### The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years . ### One stuck to old-line business traditions , while the other embraced the change . ### `` The small , good fur salon is not what it used to be , '' says Mr. Purnick , 75 years old . ### `` We make the finest product in the world , and the Americans are being kicked around . '' ### Mr. Rosen , though , believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years . ### `` You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively , '' he says . ### Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years . ### Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers : the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought she could buy a mink . ### The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $ 1.8 billion a year now , triple the level in the late 1970s . ### It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other countries . ### Jindo Furs , a large South Korean maker , says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year . ### Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made . ### High-end U.S. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them . ### But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick , who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district , say imports have cut their sales . ### A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 . ### Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage . ### Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation . ### In 1982 , he started a factory in Greece . ### Two years later , he opened one in West Germany . ### He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit . ### By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost . ### To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S . ### But six years ago he also began importing from the Far East . ### Inspired by imports , Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs , hats and flings . ### This year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green . ### He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars . ### From Asia , he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs . ### Next he will be testing pictured embroidery -LRB- called kalega -RRB- made in the Far East . ### He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets . ### Besides adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later , he adds . ### Other furriers have also benefited from leathers . ### Seymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment . ### He says it accounts for 25 % of total sales . ### Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales . ### he bought two stores , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens . ### Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing . ### Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago , and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income . ### In other moves , Mr. Rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers . ### Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest . ### Small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game . ### Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years . ### The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 sales have languished at their $ 1.8 billion peak . ### Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. , Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years . ### Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons . ### In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down . ### The animal-rights movement has n't helped sales . ### Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain . ### And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages . ### `` The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs -LCB- in the U.S . -RCB- is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. Schreibman , who is starting overseas production . ### But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure . ### `` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago . ### `` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists Mr. Purnick , the New York furrier . ### He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs . ### But Mr. Rosen responds : `` Whatever people want to buy , I 'll sell . ### The name of the game is to move goods . ### Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said . ### The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities . ### GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor , ARA Services Inc. , was suffering from a strain of the virus , officials said . ### More than 700 people work in the GTE building . ### The cafeteria remains closed . ### Dr. Andrew McBride , city health director , said his staff suspects the hepatitis , which can be highly contagious , was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus . ### The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said . ### Hepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said . ### `` From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening , '' said Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director . ### `` It 's a double-edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis . '' ### GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company , said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch . ### The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin , which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A , in anyone who has contracted the disease , Mr. Mattausch said . ### `` We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot , '' Mr. Mattausch added , `` and that means virtually everyone who works here . ### I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial `` Colombia 's Brave Publisher . '' ### It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers , not the left wing . ### This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region . ### Past Colombian government tolerance of the `` narcotraficantes '' was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands . ### Mary Poulin Palo Alto , Calif . ### I suggest that The Wall Street Journal -LRB- as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind -RRB- should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists . ### Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories . ### Reward El Espectador 's courage with real support . ### Douglas B. Evans ### COCA-COLA Co . -LRB- Atlanta -RRB- -- Anton Amon and George Gourlay were elected vice presidents of this soft-drink company . ### Mr. Amon , 46 years old , is the company 's director of quality assurance ; most recently , he served as vice president , operations , for Coca-Cola Enterprises . ### Mr. Gourlay , 48 , is manager for corporate manufacturing operations ; he was assistant vice president at the company . ### In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . ### In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . ### Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' ### Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . ### A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . ### In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . '' ### In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . ### He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested . ### Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system . ### Mr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy . ### Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % . ### Despite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week . ### It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday . ### Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed . ### Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 , the lowest level since 1980 . ### While lower joblessness is generally good news , the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped -- despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months . ### Meanwhile , average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year . ### Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record # 10.2 billion -LRB- $ 16.22 billion -RRB- last month , a much higher level than economists had predicted . ### In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner , Robin Leigh-Pemberton , Bank of England governor , conceded that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated '' when the British economy was heating up last year . ### He added that `` there 's no quick-fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said `` tight monetary policy is the right approach . '' ### Discussing the recent slide in stock prices , the central bank governor stated that `` the markets now appear to have steadied '' after the `` nasty jolt '' of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago . ### Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . '' ### Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings . ### Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when . ### C. Olivetti & Co. , claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip , unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday . ### The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips . ### Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year . ### An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . ### `` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said . ### The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London . ### Executives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market . ### Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors . ### Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December . ### `` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said . ### Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals -LRB- a role usually filled by a minicomputer -RRB- , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer . ### `` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman said . ### He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line . ### The machines will cost around $ 16,250 on average in Europe . ### The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second , or MIPS , while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS . ### Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its Ramo unit , which specializes in automating bank-branch networks . ### Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed $ 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A . ### The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase , which is expected to close within two weeks . ### erembal , the second-largest maker of food cans in France , had 1988 sales of $ 150 million . ### Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility . ### Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery , and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries . ### Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation , boosting the average monthly benefit to $ 566 from $ 541 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced . ### The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 , 1990 . ### Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month . ### The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $ 50,400 in 1990 from $ 48,000 this year . ### As mandated by law , the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future . ### This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise $ 250.80 next year to $ 3,855.60 . ### Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn $ 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 , up from $ 8,880 this year . ### The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to $ 6,840 from $ 6,480 . ### The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year . ### Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter . ### Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter , despite sales increases of less than 10 % , analysts say . ### To offset sluggish sales growth , companies have been cutting staff , mostly through attrition , and slowing the growth in research and development spending . ### Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers , such as hospitals , to hold down prices . ### Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar , which makes sales abroad more difficult . ### In some cases , competition has squeezed margins . ### Becton , Dickinson & Co. , for example , faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market . ### The Franklin Lakes , N.J. , company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % , but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % , says Jerry E. Fuller , an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc . ### Among the first of the group to post results , Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to $ 196 million , or 88 cents a share , from $ 172 million , or 76 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Sales for the company , based in Abbott Park , Ill. , rose 8.3 % to $ 1.31 billion from $ 1.21 billion . ### Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to $ 102 million , or 34 cents a share , from $ 85 million , or 28 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Sales for the Deerfield , Ill. , company rose 5.8 % to $ 1.81 billion from $ 1.71 billion . ### But not every company expects to report increased earnings . ### C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to $ 9.9 million , or 18 cents a share , from $ 20 million , or 35 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Sales fell 1.2 % to $ 190.1 million from $ 192.5 million . ### The Murray Hill , N.J. , company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market . ### In 1988 , the company earned $ 1.38 a share . ### The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design . ### Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines . ### Takeover speculation , which has been buoying stocks of supply houses , may also ease , says Peter Sidoti , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . ### `` As that wanes , you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well , '' he says . ### Hospitals companies , meanwhile , are reporting improved earnings . ### Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals , National Medical Enterprises Inc. , Los Angeles , reported net income of $ 50 million , or 65 cents a share , for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 41 million , or 56 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Humana Inc. , Louisville , Ky. , also reported favorable results , with net income of $ 66.7 million , or 66 cents , in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 58.2 million , or 59 cents , a year earlier . ### Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends . ### Most important , hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline . ### Moreover , companies have sold off many of their smaller , less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings . ### Humana 's revenues , for example , are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations . ### Says Todd Richter , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds : `` The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over . ### Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . ### The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % . ### Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . ### These figures are n't seasonally adjusted . ### A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . ### The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said . ### Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter , causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected . ### Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter , analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders . ### The Maynard , Mass. , company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes . ### Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 150.8 million , or $ 1.20 a share , from $ 223 million , or $ 1.71 a share , a year ago . ### Revenue rose 6.4 % to $ 3.13 billion from $ 2.94 billion . ### Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins . ### A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector . ### The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales . ### Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday . ### The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp . ### `` Until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said Mark Steinkrauss , Digital 's director of investor relations . ### He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter . ### DEC shares rose $ 1.375 to $ 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday . ### But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength . ### Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead . ### `` I think the next few quarters will be difficult , '' said Steven Milunovich of First Boston . ### `` Margins will remain under pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , I 'm not sure it will be a big winner . ### '' Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from $ 8.20 a share to `` well below $ 8 , '' although he has n't settled on a final number . ### One troubling aspect of DEC 's results , analysts said , was its performance in Europe . ### DEC said its overseas business , which now accounts for more than half of sales , improved in the quarter . ### It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms . ### That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms , well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % , reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds . ### `` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe , Mr. Stevens said . ### Marc Schulman , with UBS Securities in New York , dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to $ 6.80 a share from $ 8 . ### Although overall revenues were stronger , Mr. Schulman said , DEC `` drew down its European backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall . ### `` The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before , '' he said . ### Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will `` occur somewhat more leisurely '' than many of his investment colleagues expect . ### He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December , with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June . ### For reasons he would n't elaborate on , he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met , meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters . ### John R. Wilke contributed to this article . ### Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations . ### Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ 76.7 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales that increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion . ### In the year-earlier period , Colgate posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share . ### Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ 13.1 million , or 19 cents a share . ### Reuben Mark , chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America , the Far East and Europe . ### Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business , '' he said . ### Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses , which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent , jumped more than 40 % , the company said . ### Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities . ### `` We 've done a lot to improve -LRB- U.S . -RRB- results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said . ### `` Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . '' ### Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts . ### The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise . ### The company 's domestic business , especially its household products division , has performed poorly for years . ### Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales . ### For the nine months , net increased 14 % to $ 217.5 million , or $ 3.09 a share . ### Sales rose 7 % to $ 3.8 billion . ### The company earned $ 191.1 million , or $ 2.79 a share , in the year-earlier period . ### Colgate 's 1988 net income included $ 40.1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations . ### Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year . ### Separately , Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica , Mass. , to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products . ### The products -- sealants and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain fluoride that is released over time . ### The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists , a company spokeswoman said . ### Terms of the agreement were n't given . ### USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $ 71 million in cash . ### USACafes , which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible . ### The Bonanza franchise system , which generates about $ 600 million in sales annually , represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets . ### The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court , USACafes said . ### The company said it believes the suit is without merit . ### American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year . ### AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter . ### AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments . ### AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans , it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program . ### AT&T said third-quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets . ### Net income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million or 55 cents a share . ### Revenue edged up to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion . ### The latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment . ### The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts , who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago , because of continued cost-cutting efforts . ### Sales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6.4 % . ### But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products . ### Under the amended pension program , AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes . ### Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier . ### An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees . ### Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months . ### `` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc . ### But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth . ### `` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . ### Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future . ### AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses . ### But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire . ### AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie . Industriali Riunite , an Italian holding company . ### For the nine months , AT&T said net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85 a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56 a share . ### Revenue gained 3.1 % to $ 26.81 billion from $ 26 billion . ### In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , AT&T shares closed at $ 43.375 , up 87.5 cents . ### When it comes to buying and selling shares , Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one . ### Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates . ### That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings . ### But wait a second . ### Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average . ### Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing . ### Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance . ### Institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns . ### These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it . ### And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ 100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers . ### That 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs . ### But today , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one . ### Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points . ### `` Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there , '' says Seth M. Lynn , president of Axe Core Investors Inc. , an indexer based in Tarrytown , N.Y . ### `` Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money . '' ### Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies . ### They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . ### With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 . ### Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . ### One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the 500 . ### `` There is n't a boatload -LCB- of big investors -RCB- out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services . ### After tripling in size in the past five years , index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds . ### A further problem is razor-thin profits . ### Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that . ### To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free . ### `` It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account , '' says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn . ### As a result , indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money . ### And many have been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital . ### Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years , with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks , according to James Carder , the firm 's president . ### Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management . ### The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies . ### Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines . ### And in some months , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all . ### `` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. Carder adds . ### `` The more turnover , the better for our clients . '' ### Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . ### J. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . ### `` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says . ### But some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors . ### `` If the futures markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem , '' says John Zumbrunn , managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit . ### Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus of a percentage point . ### An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential . ### There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds . ### They include : ### LIMITED RISK FUNDS : These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains . ### Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower . ### The fund could invest $ 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed $ 95 . ### That leaves $ 13 , which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index . ### MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS : Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks . ### Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- . ### `` We see a lot of interest in those kind of things , '' says Frank Salerno , a vice president of Bankers Trust . ### `` People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . '' ### TILT FUNDS : This is an index fund with a bet . ### Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio . ### One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds . ### Another approach : An investor with $ 100 million might use $ 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks . ### SPECIALIZED FUNDS : Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa . ### Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment . ### Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System , for example , has about $ 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state . ### Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month , this time 4.2 % , while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest . ### The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September . ### Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares . ### For the year-earlier month , the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares , indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise , while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares , a 48 % leap . ### Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December , with increases in each month since then except at mid-July . ### Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender . ### Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders . ### Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline , some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back . ### Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging . ### The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock . ### The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 . ### The ratio is the number of trading days , at the exchange 's average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position . ### Some analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions . ### Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares . ### Varity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp. , consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp. , for $ 577.3 million of cash and securities . ### Chemical Waste Management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the New York exchange , up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238 . ### Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , the entity formed from the recent acquisition of Squibb Corp. by Bristol-Myers Co. , logged the largest volume decline , 7,592,988 shares , to 12,017,724 . ### Short interest in International Business Machines Corp. plunged to 1,425,035 shares from 2,387,226 shares a month earlier . ### Also closely watched is Exxon Corp. , where short interest slid to 4,469,167 shares from 5,088,774 . ### On a percentage basis , Germany Fund Inc. led the gainers , leaping to 67,972 shares from three shares . ### TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. led the percentage decliners , dropping to 59 shares from 183,467 . ### The Amex short interest volume leader again was Texas Air Corp. , rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949 . ### Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. posted the largest volume increase , 552,302 shares , to 2,157,656 . ### The company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs . ### Bolar has denied any wrongdoing . ### The largest volume drop -- down 445,645 shares to 141,903 -- came in shares represented by B.A.T Industries PLC 's American depositary receipts . ### The company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier Sir James Goldsmith . ### First Iberian Fund led the percentage increases , rising to 73,100 shares from 184 . ### Nelson Holdings International Ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis , to 1,000 shares from 255,923 . ### The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September . ### Your Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 . ### You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls . ### My position is one founded on both the facts and the law . ### Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling -LRB- and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative -RRB- . ### The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 . ### It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies . ### Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing . ### As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee , the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled . '' ### As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war . ### This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war . '' ### Unfortunately , this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment . ### Throughout 1988 and this year , I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this `` narcokleptocrat '' out of Panama . ### Regrettably , two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan , military or economic , for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy . ### Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D. , Mass . -RRB- ### For Vietnamese , these are tricky , often treacherous , times . ### After years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 , but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action . ### Vietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy . ### Here is how three Vietnamese are coping with change : ### The Tire King ### Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard . ### Mr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi : a private entrepreneur . ### His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days . ### Mr. Chan , now 64 years old , invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste . ### Later , he marketed glue . ### Both products were immensely popular . ### For his troubles , Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 . ### Though his operation was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials . ### Once he was held for three months without being charged . ### Things were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did . ### After years of experimenting , Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival . ### By 1982 , he was selling thousands of tires . ### Newspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire king . '' ### His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local authorities . ### District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home , which he and his large family used as both residence and factory , and demanded proof the house and equipment were his . ### He produced it . ### `` That was the first time they lost and I won , '' he says . ### He was further questioned to determine if he was `` a real working man or an exploiter . '' ### Says Mr. Chan : `` When I showed it was from my own brain , they lost for the second time . '' ### But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property . ### Warned he was to be jailed again , he fled to the countryside . ### His family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated . ### With only the clothes they were wearing , family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons . ### After six months on the run , Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled . ### He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights . ### He and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd jobs . ### Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a weekly newspaper . ### In 1988 , 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise , district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work . ### By late last year he was invited back as `` the tire king '' to display his products at a national exhibition . ### National leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements . ### Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house . ### Eighteen people pack the house 's two rooms -- the Chans , four of their 10 children with spouses , and eight of 22 grandchildren . ### Most sleep on the floor . ### Come daybreak , eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street . ### The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard , where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water . ### Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding , maybe even moving into the import-export field . ### First , however , he has unfinished business . ### When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing , they released only one of his machines . ### They did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital . ### Nor did they return his house and contents , which he values at about $ 44,000 . ### He wants to recover more than just his property , though . ### `` I want my dignity back , '' he says . ### Nguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper , Van Nghe . ### After the sixth congress , journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects . ### Mr. Ngoc , 57 years old , had solid reformist credentials : He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature . ### Appointed editor in chief in July 1987 , Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper . ### Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills . ### Readers were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered . ### One article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove , officially , he was alive . ### Another described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers . ### The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep , a former history teacher , who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association . ### Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies . ### `` Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly '' to the restyled paper , says Lai Nguyen An , a literary critic . ### After months of internal rumblings , Mr. Ngoc was fired last December . ### His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today . ### `` Under Mr. Ngoc , Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government , '' says Nguyen Duy , a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam . ### `` The paper reflected the truth . ### For the leadership , that was too painful to bear . '' ### The ` Billionaire ' ### Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s . ### Her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s . ### Mrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start . ### She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country . ### Her success , which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s , helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path . ### Her story is becoming part of local folklore . ### A lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime , she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war . ### Her instincts were capitalistic , despite her background . ### As she rode over regulations , only her friendship with party leaders , including Nguyen Van Linh , then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary , kept her out of jail . ### Following Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress , Mrs. Thi has become the darling of `` doi moi '' , the Vietnamese version of perestroika . ### The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of `` the new way of thinking . '' ### Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman . ### `` Some people call me the communist billionaire , '' she has told visitors . ### Actually , 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land . ### She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state-owned . ### She manages it with the title of general-director . ### The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities , such as corn and coffee , from farmers in the south , paying with fertilizer , farm tools and other items . ### Last year , Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice , more than 10 % of the country 's output . ### The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses . ### A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network . ### In recent years , Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company , taking a 20 % stake in newly established , partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank , and setting up Saigon Petro , which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery . ### Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about $ 2.7 million on sales of $ 150 million . ### She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year . ### She is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf . ### `` I do n't mind the competition inside the country , '' she says . ### `` I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries . ### The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings , officials at the two major rating agencies said . ### Standard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties , and `` there are potential isolated problems , '' said Hyman Grossman , a managing director . ### The agency is preparing a report , to be issued today , on the earthquake 's impact on the and casualty-insurance industry . ### The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan . ### Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing , with an eye toward a possible downgrade , the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds , long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company , Bay View Capital Corp . ### As for property and casualty insurers , Moody 's said `` preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition , '' but it `` raises concerns about potentially substantial risks '' longer-term . ### `` Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo , '' according to Moody 's . ### Your Oct. 5 editorial `` A Democratic Tax Cut '' contained an error . ### In the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loophole suggestions from lobbyists for various sectors of the economy . ### Among them , `` banana farmers . '' ### The only significant commercial banana farmers in the U.S. are in Hawaii . ### The Hawaii Banana Industry Association , to which nearly all of them belong , has no lobbyist . ### Thomas V. Reese Sr . ### Maui Banana Co . ### Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $ 2.7 million , or nine cents a share , for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 , citing factors as varied as hurricane damage , an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar . ### In the year-ago period , the company earned $ 12.9 million , or 45 cents a share , on sales of $ 247 million . ### Sales for the just-ended period fell to about $ 225 million , the maker of computer parts said . ### Nonetheless , Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter . ### `` We are positioned to come through , '' he said , noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter . ### In its second quarter last year , Western Digital earned $ 12.7 million , or 44 cents a share , on sales of $ 258.4 million . ### Mr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo , losing three days ' production because of the storm , which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure . ### Although the plant itself was n't damaged , Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost . ### The revenue will be regained in the current period , he added . ### There are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend , Mr. Johnson said , explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash . ### Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards . ### Western Digital does n't make the monitors . ### An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment . ### `` The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good , '' Mr. Johnson said . ### He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array , VGA , graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter , EGA , which has a lower resolution standard , technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units . ### Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift , he said , `` but we were able to respond much more quickly . '' ### Still , Mr. Johnson said , `` our stock is grossly undervalued . '' ### He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters , while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales . ### As part of its reorganization this week , Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products , including controllers and disk drives ; and microcomputer products , which include graphics , communications and peripheral control chips . ### Graphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip . ### Storage , which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives , represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business . ### Disk drives , which allow a computer to access its memory , generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier . ### Computer parts are getting ever smaller , Mr. Johnson said , a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business . ### As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts . ### Next year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same citya new headquarters and , a block away , a modern $ 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant . ### The plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T . ### About half of Western Digital 's business is overseas , and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue . ### Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company , he said , particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there . ### Capitalizing on that presence , Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe . ### Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution . ### Until now , BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree . ### But under the bank 's proposed statutes , an assembly of shareholders must approve board members . ### The bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury . ### BNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . ### The ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled . ### In a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . ### BNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals . ### BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange . ### The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal ; Consob , the stock exchange regulatory body , reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension . ### Switzerland 's wholesale price index increased 0.3 % in September from August , and was up 3.9 % from a year ago , marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4 % on a year-to-year basis , the government reported . ### The government attributed the 0.3 % month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices . ### In August , the index was up 0.2 % from the previous month , and was up 4.5 % on a year-to-year basis . ### The wholesale price index , based on 1963 as 100 , was 180.9 in September . ### American Express Co. posted a 21 % increase in third quarter net income despite a sharp rise in reserves for Third World loans at its banking unit . ### Aided by a sharp gain in its travel business , American Express said net rose to $ 331.8 million , or 77 cents a share , from $ 273.9 million , or 64 cents a share . ### The year-earlier figures included $ 9.9 million , or three cents a share , in income from discontinued operations . ### Income from continuing operations was up 26 % . ### Revenue rose 24 % to $ 6.5 billion from $ 5.23 billion . ### The travel , investment services , insurance and banking concern added $ 110 million to reserves for credit losses at its American Express Bank unit , boosting the reserve to $ 507 million as of Sept. 30 . ### The bank 's Third World debt portfolio totals $ 560 million , down from $ 2.2 billion at the end of 1986 . ### The bank charged off $ 53 million in loans during the quarter . ### At the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit , net rose 17 % to a record $ 240.8 million on a 19 % revenue increase . ### The figures exclude businesses now organized as American Express Information Services Co . ### American Express card charge volume rose 12 % . ### Travel sales rose 11 % , led by gains in the U.S . ### At IDS Financial Services , the financial planning and mutual fund unit , net rose 19 % to a record $ 47.6 million on a 33 % revenue gain . ### Assets owned or managed rose 20 % to $ 45 billion , and mutual fund sales rose 45 % in the quarter to $ 923 million . ### American Express Bank earnings fell 50 % to $ 21.3 million from $ 42.5 million despite a 29 % revenue gain . ### The results include $ 106 million of tax benefits associated with previous years ' Third World loan activity , compared with $ 15 million a year earlier . ### Profit rose 38 % at American Express Information Services to $ 21.6 million . ### Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , as previously reported , had net of $ 65.9 million , reversing a $ 3.5 million loss a year earlier ; its latest results include a $ 37 million gain from the sale of an institutional money management business . ### American Express 's share of Shearson 's earnings was $ 41 million , after preferred stock dividends ; it owns about 68 % of Shearson 's common . ### For the nine months , American Express said net rose 11 % to $ 899.8 million , or $ 2.09 a share , from $ 807.5 million , or $ 1.89 a share . ### Revenue rose 24 % to $ 18.73 billion from $ 15.09 billion . ### Textron Inc. , hampered by a slowdown in its defense sales , reported an 8 % decline in per-share earnings on nearly flat revenue for its third quarter . ### The aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5 % to $ 59.5 million from $ 62.8 million . ### Revenue of $ 1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year 's $ 1.72 billion . ### Per-share net of 66 cents , down from 72 cents , fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding . ### The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business , lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets . ### Net was aided by a lower income tax rate . ### Profit before taxes fell 17 % to $ 84.4 million from $ 101.4 million . ### For the nine months , Textron reported net of $ 182.1 million , or $ 2.06 a share , on revenue of $ 5.41 billion . ### A year ago , net was $ 170.4 million , or $ 1.93 a share , on revenue of $ 5.3 billion . ### The nine-month results included a $ 9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales , and $ 29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt . ### Textron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC , a British maker of industrial fasteners , but do include interest costs of $ 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel . ### A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets . ### For the quarter , Textron said aerospace revenue , including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture , declined 9.8 % to $ 755.9 million from $ 838.3 million , an indication of slowing government defense work . ### As the Hunt brothers ' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year , Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men . ### But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988 . ### The Peruvian mineral concern 's $ 251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers ' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market . ### Minpeco now says it is willing to settle for up to $ 65.7 million from each brother , although the actual amount would probably be much less . ### Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson , W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern 's proposal . ### Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it , although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service , which claims the brothers owe $ 1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases . ### The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval . ### Under it , the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80 % of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors , including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , which is seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan . ### A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings . ### In both cases , Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie . ### With support from the IRS , Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco 's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS . ### Minpeco has threatened a `` volcano '' of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court . ### Minpeco said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved by Judge Abramson , who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week . ### Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray , attorney for Manufacturers Hanover , called it `` silly '' and said he would fight it in court . ### `` The thing is so fluid right now that there 's really no way to say what will happen , '' says Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III , who represents the IRS in the case . ### `` Developments like this are hard to predict . ### Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc. , Toledo , Ohio , following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp. , Cleveland . ### The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $ 88 million , Banc One said . ### The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets , Banc One said . ### Society Corp. already has branches in the area , and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society , according to industry sources . ### The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter . ### Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $ 6.07 billion in the latest week , the sharpest increase in almost two years . ### The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade group , rose to $ 356.1 billion , a record . ### The $ 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 . ### The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds . ### Individual investors , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds , said Jacob Dreyer , vice president and chief economist of the Institute . ### `` Insitutional investors , on the other hand , reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday , '' Mr. Dreyer said . ### Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday , according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report , a Holliston , Mass. , newsletter . ### The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier , Donoghue 's said . ### At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday , the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % . ### Likewise , certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday . ### The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $ 2.23 billion to $ 85.49 billion . ### The 235 general-purpose funds increased $ 2.53 billion to $ 116.56 billion , while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.3 billion to $ 154.05 billion . ### Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles , the institution 's executive chairman , Mohamed Basir Ismail , said . ### Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan , Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85 . ### He said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans . ### So the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars -LRB- US$ 457 million -RRB- in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank , and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital . ### The predicament , he added , was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse , which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history . ### The subsidiary , Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. , was left with M$ 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators . ### Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders ' funds . ### Each time , the bank 's 90 % shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd. , or Petronas , the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution . ### In five years , Petronas , which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise , has spent about M$ 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank . ### Tan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank . ### Malaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan . ### Once the plan is approved , Tan Sri Basir said , most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$ 160 million and M$ 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 . ### For the previous financial year , the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$ 168 million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans , he said . ### Malaysia 's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers , said Tan Sri Basir . ### But public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$ 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party , the United Malays National Organization , to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur . ### The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 . ### `` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said Tan Sri Basir , who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to ### As well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital . ### At the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions . ### Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans . ### White , 24 years old , a singer in her church choir , she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan . ### `` I felt kind of safe , '' she says . ### No longer . ### When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion , Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics . ### Then a political novice , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers . ### Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio . ### `` This is one where I cross party lines , '' she says , rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent , Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter . ### `` People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue . ### Now it has -- especially for people my age . '' ### Polls bear out this warning , but after a decade of increased Republican influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter . ### Unless he closes the gap , Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month . ### Going into the 1990s , the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past . ### This change comes less from a shift in public opinion , which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade , than in the boundaries of the debate . ### New Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion , but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling , Webster vs. Missouri , has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue . ### Before July , pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion . ### Now , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces . ### A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest . ### `` If Webster had n't happened , you would n't be here , '' Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women . ### `` We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter... and no one would have heard us . '' ### New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year . ### The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures . ### In Cherry Hill , the National Abortion Rights Action League , whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters , targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause . ### The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders ; `` I wish I could go work out , '' says a slim activist . ### A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to `` man and woman '' Election Day phones . ### No age group is more sensitive than younger voters , like Ms. Ehman . ### A year ago this fall , New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis , according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute . ### A matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal . ### Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter . ### Abortion alone ca n't explain this shift , but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate . ### By a 2-to-1 ratio , voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue . ### `` The times are my times , '' says Mr. Florio . ### The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark `` I'm-coming-down-your-throat '' intensity , but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently , he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward . ### After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions . ### `` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? '' ### Mr. Courter , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago . ### Looking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor . ### It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate . ### `` He does n't know himself , '' Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's position . ### Even abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence . ### `` He does n't want to lead the people , '' says Richard Traynor , president of New Jersey Right to Life . ### Moreover , by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition , Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment . ### He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate ; and by wavering on this issue and abortion , he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides . ### Elected to Congress in 1978 , the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan . ### Like many of his colleagues , he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors . ### Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences , and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor , Thomas Kean , in the 1981 Republican primary here . ### The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean . ### While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office . ### Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter , but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government . ### Mr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner . ### Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers . ### Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head . ### He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park . ### Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office . ### `` I do n't think we do now , '' he says . ### `` I think we did . '' ### Asked the same question after his appearance , Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today . ### When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden . ### Details and Camden are essential Florio . ### Elected to Congress as a `` Watergate baby '' in 1974 , he ran for governor three years later . ### In the opinion of many , he has n't stopped running since , even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 . ### His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge . ### With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market , Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage . ### More than ever , his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state . ### Auto insurance rates are soaring . ### A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer . ### In Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' ### Mr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses . ### He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase state revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste . ### Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . ### Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead . ### The lyric chosen -- `` long strange night '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar . ### The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines , but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption . ### His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state , and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment , he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater , Trenton State College . ### Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency . ### Pasquale Pignatelli , an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band , speaks sadly of Mr. Florio . ### `` I am a devout Catholic , '' says Mr. Pignatelli , a 40-year-old health officer . ### `` I ca n't support him because of abortion . '' ### Bill Wames Sr. , 72 , is Catholic too , but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion . ### A security guard at a cargo terminal , he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating `` The US 1 Band . '' ### `` I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases , '' he says . ### `` If you want more opinions ask my wife . ### She has lots of opinions . ### Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2 % in September , pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs , the Labor Department reported . ### Energy costs , which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs . ### The report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday . ### The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news , closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 . ### Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall . ### But many economists were not nearly as jubilant . ### The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months , they warned . ### They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods . ### `` I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall , '' said Joel Popkin , a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here . ### `` It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months . '' ### `` We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months , and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now , '' said Jay Woodworth , chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York . ### Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month , many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too . ### As a result , many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did . ### But retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September . ### Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices , many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year . ### Still , some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind . ### `` It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued Edward Yardeni , chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York . ### In both 1987 and 1988 , consumer prices rose 4.4 % . ### A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year , but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 % . ### Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices . ### `` The bottom line is , it seems to me that the economic environment has become very , very competitve for a lot of businesses , '' he said . ### `` Back in 1987-88 , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt they could raise prices . '' ### Now , he said , a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand . ### The mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance . ### The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day . ### In the past several days , however , the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets . ### Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy . ### Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September . ### Transportation costs actually fell 0.5 % , and housing costs gained only 0.1 % . ### Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % , but that was after three months of declines . ### Medical costs continued their steep ascent , rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases . ### Car prices , another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month , still showed declines at the consumer level . ### They dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers . ### Food prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row , far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year . ### Separately , the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3 % in September , after adjusting for inflation , following a 0.7 % decline in August . ### All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations . ### Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department 's consumer price index for September . ### After watching interest in the sport plummet for years , the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift . ### Across the country , resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers . ### Some have built health spas , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski . ### And this week , the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a $ 7 million advertising campaign . ### Such efforts -- unheard of only a few years ago -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $ 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry . ### Since the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average , compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s . ### Last season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years . ### By some estimates , nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s . ### Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts . ### But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers . ### Skiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport . ### In its new ad campaign , created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. , Chicago , the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people . ### One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier . ### `` Ski school is great , '' cries out a tot , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope . ### `` You 'll never know'til you try , '' says a black skier . ### `` We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff , '' says Kathe Dillmann , a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association , the trade group sponsoring the campaign . ### Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety . ### But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall . ### `` We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall , '' says Ms. Dillmann . ### `` Most people think if you slip , you 'll wind up in a body cast . '' ### The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers ; normally , they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities . ### But in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the Angel Fire , Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts . ### Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business . ### Since 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids . ### Vail , Colo. , now has a playland that looks like an old mining town ; kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold . ### For $ 15 , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad . ### A few years ago , parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children . ### `` Most parents who had to go through that never came back , '' says Michael Shannon , president of Vail Associates Inc. , which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts . ### To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies . ### In one phone call , ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons . ### And resorts are adding other amenities , such as pricey restaurants , health spas and vacation packages with a twist . ### During Winter Carnival week , for example , visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride . ### `` People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says Don Borgeson , executive director of Angel Fire , N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce . ### The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions . ### But some think that 's being overly optimistic . ### For one thing , it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive : a lift ticket can cost up to $ 35 a day and equipment prices are rising . ### And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions . ### An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports , as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor . ### `` Even if they could bring in that many new skiers , I do n't know if -LCB- the industry -RCB- could handle that kind of an increase , '' says I. William Berry , editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah , N.Y . ### `` Most people will come on the weekend , the slopes will be overcrowded and then these -LCB- new skiers -RCB- wo n't come back . ### They did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled , and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either . ### But you knew that , did n't you ? ### They are supposed to play the game next Tuesday , in Candlestick Park here . ### The theory is that the stadium , damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there . ### Like just about everything else , that remains to be seen . ### Aftershocks could intervene . ### But , at least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side . ### It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake , but the name of this column is `` On Sports , '' so I feel obliged to do so . ### You might be interested to know that baseball , not survival , appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday , a half-hour before game time , when the quake struck . ### As soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show . ### One fan , seated several rows in front of the open , upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed , faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted , `` We arranged that just for you guys '' I thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . '' ### I 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them . ### Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat . ### `` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my own reaction . ### A women said she saw the park 's light standards sway . ### A man said he saw the upper rim undulate . ### I saw neither . ### Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played . ### `` I was near the top of the stadium , and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat , but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes , '' confessed a friend . ### `` I guess I thought , ` This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out ' '' ### Here in the Global Village , though , folks do not stay uninformed for long . ### Electrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful . ### Within a few minutes , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear . ### Its Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 , then 6.9 , then 7.0 . ### A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed , as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland . ### People had died . ### At 5:40 p.m. , scheduled game time having passed , some fans chanted `` Let 's Play Ball . '' ### No longer innocent , they qualified as fools . ### The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend . ### Outside , I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete . ### `` Pieces of Candlestick , '' they said . ### The crowd remained good natured , even bemused . ### TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while , a few feet away , others watched the interviews on their portable TVs . ### The only frenzy I saw was commercial : Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items . ### The traffic jam out of the park was monumental . ### It took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away . ### The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours . ### At my hotel , the Westin , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else . ### With Garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the Amfac , had been hit harder : A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away . ### The Westin staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets . ### I fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket . ### I expected him to say , `` I told you so , '' but he already was snoring . ### The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant . ### My response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact . ### Should the rest of the Series be played at all ? ### The quake and baseball were n't related , unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics . ### That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it . ### Two ironies intrude . ### This has been widely dubbed the BART Series , after the local subway line , and the Bay Bridge Series . ### Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti , the late baseball commissioner , and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins . ### A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way . ### Still , its edge is lost . ### It now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without `` off '' days . ### And I will never again complain about a rainout . ### The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers . ### But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $ 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp . ### For more than a decade , banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds . ### Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank loans for the $ 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc . ### One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds . ### That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover . ### All $ 3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks . ### Charles Nathan , co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. , says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs . ### But the UAL collapse , he says , `` may tell you it 's not going to work that easily . '' ### David Batchelder , a mergers adviser in La Jolla , Calif. , who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year , says that banks have been `` preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing . '' ### Mr. Batchelder says that in the past , banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price , with the loans secured by the target company 's assets . ### Another 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds , which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans . ### Mr. Checchi 's purchase of NWA , Mr. Batchelder notes , `` was probably the most aggressive to date , '' with bank debt at 85 % of the purchase price . ### But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp 's `` failure to deliver '' on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group `` is very distressing to potential users of a ` highly-confident ' letter from commercial banks . '' ### His client , Mr. Davis , used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL ; Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group . ### Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation , or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers . ### In the wake of Campeau 's problems , prices of junk bonds tumbled , throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales . ### Mark Solow , senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers . ### But he warns that banks will have `` to have enough discipline '' not to make loans that are too risky . ### In fact , Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . ### `` We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor , '' says a bank spokesman . ### James B. Lee , head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. , said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance . ### As evidence , he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor . ### Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers . ### Arthur Fleischer Jr. , a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds . ### One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $ 10.7 billion , or $ 175 a share . ### A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial , not political , drawbacks of junk bonds . ### But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time . ### In the end , Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount 's bid to $ 200 a share . ### Some Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid , without junk bonds , was a factor in his losing the company . ### Time eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc . ### The success of the NWA financing , and the failure of the UAL deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks . ### Japanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt , according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner . ### But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL . ### Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new , lower bid . ### Takanori Mizuno , chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. , a Tokyo research center on finance and economics , says , `` The junk bond market became very jittery , and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies . ### Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here , alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made `` false , deceptive and misleading '' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements . ### Harley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group , led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer , violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made , it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law . ### Mr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment . ### But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures , the Rochester , N.Y. , investor said `` we complied with every law , '' and he denied any wrongdoing . ### The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson , or seek representation on the company 's board . ### Harley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party . ### Inland Steel Industries Inc. , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings . ### The nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned $ 18.3 million , or 43 cents a share , compared with $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , a year earlier , when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing . ### Sales fell to $ 981.2 million from $ 1.02 billion . ### The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share . ### Moreover , the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ 1.16 a share . ### In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Inland closed yesterday at $ 35.875 a share , down $ 1 . ### The company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector . ### However , the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter . ### Third-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period , and 17 % from this year 's second quarter . ### Profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ 26 a ton , from $ 66 a ton a year earlier and $ 57 a ton a quarter earlier . ### Analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products . ### Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar , hot-rolled and structural steel . ### Structural steel , which primarily serves the construction market , was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop , Mr. Bradford said . ### The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs . ### The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union . ### Meanwhile , the company 's service center segment , which saw operating profit drop to $ 11.5 million from $ 30.7 million a year ago , experienced much of the same demand and cost problems , as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system . ### Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is `` clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets . '' ### However , he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels , and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter . ### In the first nine months , profit was $ 113 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on sales of $ 3.19 billion , compared with $ 204.5 million , or $ 5.76 a share , on sales of $ 3.03 billion , a year earlier . ### The `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth . ### When things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately . ### However , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake-resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival . ### America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully `` aftershock-resistant . '' ### Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information . ### That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity . ### And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks . ### In today 's markets , specialists -LRB- on the New York Stock Exchange -RRB- and `` upstairs '' market makers -LRB- in the over-the-counter market -RRB- are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process . ### When they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone . ### And when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -LRB- the way prices are determined -RRB- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time . ### Last Friday the 13th -LRB- as well as two years ago this week -RRB- the markets became unlinked . ### When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility . ### Lack of important , needed information can cause fear . ### Fear is the father of panic . ### Panic frequently results in irrational behavior . ### And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe . ### When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at various prices -RRB- be made available to all , not just to market makers . ### Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . ### To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -LRB- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -RRB- by investors -- particularly institutional investors . ### Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . ### What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service . ### Liquidity is not a service . ### It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news . ### Market makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit . ### As a result , while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker -LRB- which is micro-liquidity for the investor -RRB- , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has changed . ### In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers -LRB- a result of some post-1987 crash studies -RRB- also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market . ### In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at each price -RRB- entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders . ### Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis . ### Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a `` national market system '' -LRB- not yet achieved -RRB- almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 . ### Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe `` aftershocks . '' ### Were we smart or just lucky ? ### I 'm not certain . ### But I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets . ### Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood , N.J . ### NOW YOU SEE IT , now you do n't . ### The recession , that is . ### The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up . ### So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane . ### For the past seven years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy . ### Some may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession . ### Different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher . ### For those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will be a recession year , many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio . ### In a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries . ### A heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds . ### It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand . ### But that may not be possible , because recessions often take investors by surprise . ### `` They always seem to come a bit later than you expect . ### When they do hit , they hit fast , '' says David A. Wyss , chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc . ### Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon , Mr. Wyss advises people who do that `` the best thing to be in is long that is , 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds . '' ### The reason is simple , Mr. Wyss says : `` Interest rates almost always decline during recession . '' ### As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds . ### They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do . ### That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds . ### But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much , because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon . ### Long-term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price . ### But not just any bonds will do . ### Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' Mr. Wyss says . ### As times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts . ### This hurts the price of corporate bonds . ### Also , he notes , `` most corporate bonds are callable . '' ### That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value -LRB- plus , in some cases , a sweetener -RRB- . ### When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . ### But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny . ### If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all . ### It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University . ### `` Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could be a disaster . '' ### Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government . ### During an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipals . ### And , like corporates , many municipal bonds are callable . ### But a few experts , going against the consensus , do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing . ### One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach , director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. , a brokerage house in Houston , who thinks that `` we 're either in a recession or about to go into one . '' ### What 's more , he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual : `` Once the downturn comes , it 's going to be very hard to reverse . '' ### Investors , he advises , `` should be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds . ### Because he sees `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon . ### Instead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills . ### Greg Confair , president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash . ### He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad . ### `` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says . ### The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a `` soft landing , '' he says , requires the Fed to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor . '' ### A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. Confair adds . ### It has to be engineered over and over again , month after month . ### He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw . '' ### And , in a sense , that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios . ### It comes down to a question of whether to try to `` time '' the market . ### For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments . ### Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % , including both dividends and price appreciation . ### That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid . ### Moreover , because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing . ### `` Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says David Katz , chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York . ### Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years . ### Investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says . ### Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy . ### Frequent trading runs up high commission costs . ### And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time . ### Still , few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming . ### After all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined . ### According to Ned Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis , Fla. , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % , and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started . ### By the time a recession is `` official '' -LRB- two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product -RRB- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done-and , in the typical case , the recession is already half over . ### About six months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as investors anticipate a recovery . ### The average recession lasts about a year . ### Unfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases . ### But whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession . ### For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions . ### Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is , low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share . ### `` Low P-E '' stocks , he says , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . '' ### In good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance . ### Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies . ### Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession , he says . ### And in any case , he argues , stocks of small companies are `` almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 , 1987 , just before the crash . '' ### For example , Mr. Arbel says , stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow . ### Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health . -RRB- ### That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash , Mr. Arbel says . ### And it 's way above the ratio -LRB- 7.5 times cash flow -RRB- that bigger companies are selling for . ### Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries . ### Food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples . ### Recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick . ### George Putnam III , editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston , offers one final tip for recession-wary investors . ### `` Keep some money available for opportunities , '' he says . ### `` If the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest . '' ### Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . ### Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others . ### The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions . ### Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt . ### But while the overall market improved , the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk-bond prices rose . ### Yesterday , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a $ 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp . ### And Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night . ### The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar . ### Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk . ### Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped . ### On Wednesday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million . ### Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction . ### Last week , the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock . ### Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions . ### `` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and -LCB- Chicago & North Western -RCB- is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp . ### Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals . ### Dan Baldwin , managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management , said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package . ### If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . '' ### Mr. Baldwin likes the offering . ### But several mutual-fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class . ### While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good , they do n't view it as the best . ### To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds , portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker . ### The bonds are expected to have a 14 % coupon rate . ### The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. , Chicago & North Western 's parent company . ### Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring . ### According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group , which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each . ### That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % . ### Despite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market . ### Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point . ### In the Treasury market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount . ### The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows . ### That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower . ### The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month , slightly lower than some economists had expected . ### But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys . ### Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed , with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher . ### Yesterday , the Fed executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system . ### The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week . ### The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans . ### It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes . ### `` The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively . ### They are telling us that -LCB- 8 % -RCB- is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC . ### The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 to yield 7.955 % , compared with 100 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday . ### The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 to yield 8.007 % . ### Short-term rates rose yesterday . ### The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . ### Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday . ### The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 . ### Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 . ### Here are details of the auction : ### Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . ### Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . ### The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . ### Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities . ### Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by to point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains . ### Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and RJR 's 13 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 after trading at below par earlier this week . ### Investment-grade bonds were unchanged . ### Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector . ### Traders estimated that more than $ 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers . ### There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios . ### According to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield . ### Away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest . ### Long dollar bonds were flat to up point . ### New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up at 98 bid to yield about 7.32 % , down 0.03 percentage point . ### The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake , although traders said market participants remained cautious . ### California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official . ### It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve , said Cindy Katz , assistant director of California 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated . ### Meanwhile , new issuance was slow . ### The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority . ### A balance of $ 25.8 million remained in late order-taking , according to the lead manager . ### Mortgage securities generally ended to point higher , but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts . ### Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages . ### Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about at 109 . ### If the refinancing plan clears Congress , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them . ### In the current-coupon sector , a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings . ### Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 , up 9 , 9 % ### % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 . ### While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve , underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable . ### Two new Remics totaling $ 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday . ### British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson . ### The Treasury 11 % bond due was down at 111 to yield 10.09 % , while the 11 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 to yield 12.94 % . ### In Japan , the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in West Germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % . ### THE PANHANDLER approaches , makes his pitch . ### It may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $ 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo n't you give him the difference ? ### Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address . . . ### Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express , most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this . ### But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you . ### Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals . ### But will it ? ### In a distressing number of cases , no . ### In fact , the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth . ### Last year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities . ### While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other operators , including fraudulent expenses . ### In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries . ### It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud . ### But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent . ### State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging . ### The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established . ### The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program . ### Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test . ### Which , it should be added , does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway . ### Without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself . ### On this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut . ### `` A lot of donors just get taken . '' ### Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center . ### The state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs . ### The telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located . ### Running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed . ### The Arthritis Foundation , the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs , not overhead . ### With some other charities , however , its the other way around . ### The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society , for example , took in $ 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children . ### By the time it paid its expenses it only had $ 120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child . ### The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago , along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. , its Houston-based fund raiser . ### Both deny wrongdoing . ### The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come . ### Michael Burns , president of Telesystems , says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case , noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's . ### Meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds . ### Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising . ### State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court . ### It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression . ### This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently . ### The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . ### In making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . ### Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . ### Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give . ### Attorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America . ### According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit , Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an additional $ 1,000 on top of them , if they contributed as little as $ 7 . ### But the total value of the prizes was only $ 5,000 and most `` winners '' will receive just 10 cents , according to the attorney general 's office . ### The suit is still pending in Illinois state court . ### Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further . ### While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface . ### There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all . ### One maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit . ### The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue . ### What it does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself . ### `` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says William Webster , attorney general of Missouri . ### `` By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . '' ### Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win $ 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ 5 to cancer education . ### `` A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages . ### I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says . ### Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls . ### Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs . ### The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it . ### `` We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name . ### Most of them do n't last for long , but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us , '' says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association . ### And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it . ### A couple in Rockford , Ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , without permission from the group . ### MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ 613 , along with a letter saying that was the charity 's `` share . '' ### The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission . ### The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford , law enforcement officials report . ### Denise McDonald , a spokeswoman for MADD , says , `` It 's scary , because anybody could do this.`` f this.`` f ### Mr. Johnson is a staf reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Chicago bureau . ### Overhead costs at some of the largest charities , in millions of dollars ### British Airways PLC , a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. , washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines . ### Specifically , the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL . ### In addition , British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said `` the original deal is closed . '' ### Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group , which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union , failed to obtain financing for the $ 6.79 billion transaction . ### The carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL . ### However , company officials said they plan to take `` no initiatives '' to resurrect the transaction , and `` are n't aware '' of any restructured bid in the making . ### Collectively , the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground . ### The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday , with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place . ### However , in response to the British Air decision , United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out . ### Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board `` at the earliest time possible . '' ### Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation . ### UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement . ### UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf , who is leading the management end of the buy-out , has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal . ### In another setback yesterday , United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws . ### In an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department . ### But there was one bright spot yesterday . ### The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake . ### The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' ### Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . ### Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management . ### British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier . ### The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week . ### UAL stock dropped $ 1.625 yesterday to $ 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . ### UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement . ### In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report , Mr. Stevens said , `` We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all . ### We 're not rushing into anything . ### We do n't want to be party to a second rejection . '' ### Indeed , British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment . ### The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution . ### The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts . ### `` The -LCB- buy-out -RCB- consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing , '' a British Air spokesman said . ### British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier . ### Most of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers . ### Even before British Air 's announcement , pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options . ### The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul , Weiss , Rifkind Wharton & Garrison . ### They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky , the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 fight to take control of the airline . ### UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid . ### They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction . ### The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the lead banks in the transaction , failed to obtain $ 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan . ### Italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier , the state statistical institute Istat said . ### The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier . ### Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier , while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % , Istat said . ### For the first six months , wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before , reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales . ### Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier . ### Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period , while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago . ### Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their leaders , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority . ### A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets . ### The plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday . ### But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday . ### Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist . ### Afterward , leaders of the dissident Democrats relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned . ### The decision is a setback for President Bush , who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate . ### Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage . ### Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder . ### Still , Sen. Bob Packwood -LRB- R. , Ore. -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year . ### He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect . ### But Sen. Mitchell , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed . ### Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year . ### Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . '' ### Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision . ### That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators . ### The House version of the bill does include the tax cut . ### Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation . ### To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue . ### The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it . ### `` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , a leader of those Democrats . ### The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year . ### The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years . ### The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 . ### As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . ### For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . ### That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . ### The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . ### The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses . ### Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty . ### Westmoreland Coal Co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results . ### The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million . ### For the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents a share . ### In the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8.5 million , or $ 1.03 a share . ### Last year 's net loss of $ 3,524,000 included a benefit of $ 1,640,000 from an accounting change . ### Revenue for the nine months rose to $ 449 million from $ 441.1 million . ### In an interview , Pemberton Hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest . ### In the latest nine months , Mr. Hutchinson said , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier . ### In addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since Jan. 1 . ### He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters . ### Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region . ### The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News , Va . ### Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas . ### For the past couple of years , Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business . ### Marginal operations and assets have been sold . ### The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . ### About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated . ### Even perks have been reduced . ### For example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % . ### `` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program . ### `` Much of what we set out to do is completed . '' ### But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained . ### One difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season . ### `` I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said . ### `` We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient . ### It 's a process that never really ends . '' ### Nevertheless , Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same . '' ### For all of 1988 , the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ 134,000 on revenue of $ 593.5 million . ### An accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents a share . ### In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy , its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia . ### Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines . ### Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . '' ### He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River . ### Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s . ### `` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said . ### `` Coal prices , while not skyrocketing , will grow modestly in real terms , we think . ### Chase Manhattan Corp. , after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building , has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower . ### Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 . ### The current transaction cost the bank approximately $ 140 million . ### Of that amount , $ 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself . ### The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers , most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 . ### The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof . ### The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza . ### As part of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash . ### Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations . ### He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million . ### As the building 's new owner , Chase will have its work cut out for it . ### Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space , and Salomon Brothers Inc. , whose headquarters is in the building , also plans to move shortly . ### In addition , another major building tenant , Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities , likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation . ### New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants . ### Even with its striking views of the New York harbor , the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards . ### And Chase will have to spend approximately $ 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises . ### WALL STREET , SHAKE hands with George Orwell . ### The author of the futuristic novel `` 1984 '' invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is , anything negative about the policies and practices of the state . ### Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start . ### Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous , reassuring , and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better , safer or cheaper than they really are . ### When something undeniably nasty happens , a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear , much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers . ### For example , we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago . ### According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market , it never happened . ### In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 , 1987 , was just a big blip . ### Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term , New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only `` a major technical correction . '' ### Another much-beloved saying , however , this one in plain English , holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it is a duck . ### On Oct. 29 , 1929 -- a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the DJ industrials fell 12.8 % . ### In the `` technical correction '' of two years ago , they lost a whopping 22.6 % . -RRB- ### Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock . ### These people used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone . ### Either way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor . ### Of the major New York-based securities firms , only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers . ### At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , they are `` financial consultants . '' ### At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , Prudential Bache Securities , and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , they are `` account executives . '' ### At PaineWebber Inc. , they are `` investment executives . '' ### Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified , broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products . ### It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle , do n't feel . ### `` Its almost product de jour , '' grouses one account executive at Dean Witter . ### The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product . ### The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them , either . ### A case in point : `` government-plus '' bond funds . ### What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds ? ### What could be better than getting a tad more income from them -LRB- the plus -RRB- than other people ? ### Indeed , conservative investors , many of them elderly , have poured more than $ 50 billion into such funds , which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options , a gambler 's game . ### When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished , look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker . ### This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships , many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments . ### They are still being sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks they had under the old label . ### In such cases , the game has n't changed , only the name . ### In others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has changed . ### For example , `` no load '' mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission . ### Getting out of them , however , may be a different story now . ### Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't . ### In recent years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares . ### Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds ? ### The mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well . ### And do n't expect anyone to change the term `` blue chip , '' either , even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were . ### American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , for one , is still a favorite of widows , orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side , it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture . ### Also , blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years . ### Larry Biehl , a money manager in San Mateo , Calif. , blames that on the advent of program trading , in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail . ### Blue chips , he says , `` are now being referred to as poker chips . '' ### Finally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did . ### Before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects . ### Now , says Mr. Biehl , value investing often means `` looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble . '' ### To institutional investors or brokers , he adds , a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up . ### Ms. Bettner covers personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau . ### I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries . ### If the whole story were told , it would read something like this : ### During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made . ### The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings -LRB- and management bonuses -RRB- ; the price , a sea of bad loans . ### For the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits . ### The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans -LRB- the Brady Plan -RRB- . ### The banks will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy , they have no alternative but to go along . ### George A. Wiegers ### Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 . ### Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board . ### Separately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period . ### Sales rose 9 % to $ 921.6 million from $ 845.7 million , with sales of the company 's operations `` well above '' the year earlier-period . ### For the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period . ### Sales rose 6 % to $ 2.77 billion from $ 2.61 billion . ### In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 45.50 a share , up 25 cents . ### When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the chance . ### Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . ### And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business . ### Not only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market value of the company . ### There was just one sticking point : The two had a prior commitment . ### Just seven months earlier , they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit `` Batman . '' ### But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross , would empathize and let the producers go , knowing the Sony offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . '' ### He figured wrong . ### Last week , following fruitless settlement talks , Warner , now merging with Time Inc. , filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters . ### Sony promptly countersued , charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business . ### The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides : As one Sony executive puts it , `` It 's World War III . '' ### That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business . ### And they are a very odd team in any case . ### Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York . ### He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees . ### Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser . ### Yet , they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood . ### And despite their share of duds , they make movies that make money . ### That is a skill Sony badly needs -- and Warner is loath to lose . ### Although Columbia had a good summer with `` Ghostbusters II '' and `` When Harry Met Sally , '' rivals such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office . After five years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , Columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits . ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected . ### Their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them . ### Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple . '' ### It falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing . ### With 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success . ### Sometimes , as with `` Batman , '' the pair really do make the film . ### In that case , Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production . ### `` They 're the best production talent around , '' says Brian De Palma , beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel `` Bonfire of the Vanities . '' ### On that film , which is to start shooting in a few months , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script . ### And when you 're making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get , '' Mr. De Palma adds . ### `` I wish they were around 24 hours a day . '' ### And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention . ### Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure . ### `` We 've had a few bombs , '' admits Mr. Peters . ### `` But by and large this company has only been profitable . '' ### He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia . ### We practically ran our own studio . '' ### Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing . ### `` Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success , '' says Robert Bookman , an agent at Creative Artists Agency . ### Mark Johnson , the producer of `` Rainman , '' chimes in : `` He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority . . . . ### It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material . '' ### Mr. Peters , on the other hand , has fewer fans in Hollywood , and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully . ### He gets better reviews as a creative whiz , an enthusiast , an idea man . ### He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did . ### Barbra Streisand made him famous . ### He cut her hair . ### He lived with her . ### He came to produce her records and her movies -- `` A Star Is Born '' and `` The Main Event . '' ### Thrice married but now single , Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of `` Batman . '' ### Mr. Guber , by contrast , has been married to one woman for more than 20 years . ### But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team , Hollywood associates say . ### `` Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal , '' says one agent . ### `` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . '' ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way . ### Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film . ### Says Mr. Simpson : `` The script was unreadable . ### We reinvented it . ### We are the producers of that movie . ### They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers . ### When Roger Birnbaum , an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s , left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio , they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop , including `` Rainman '' and `` Batman . '' ### Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner . ### `` I was upset with Roger , I fumpered and schmumpered , '' says Mr. Peters . ### `` But he wanted to pursue his own dream , and he went . '' ### Still , Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was `` one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood . '' ### The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive , '' adds Mr. Birnbaum , who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co . ### `` Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone . ### Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific . . . . '' ### Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey , which became `` Gorillas in the Mist . '' ### He says , `` Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey . ### I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas . '' ### Universal Studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner . ### More recently , Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner , for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes , the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest . ### Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` Gorillas in the Mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work . ### Money helped , too . ### Ultimately , they paid more than $ 1 million for the rights . ### The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers . ### Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest . -RRB- ### It 's hardly astonishing -LRB- given the men 's track record -RRB- that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters . ### But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first . ### Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract . ### But though `` people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters , it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works , '' says Steven Tisch , a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber . ### `` This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- its about whether the ink is red or black . ### In the case of Peter and Jon , the ink has been very , very black . '' ### Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago . ### Recruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo . '' ### In 1976 , he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` The Deep , '' and `` Midnight Express . '' ### In 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters , by then a successful producer in his own right , after the death of Mr. Bogart . ### While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive . ### Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear . '' ### And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates . ### The studio says it stuck with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner . '' ### Mr. Guber replies that `` this is a Goliath , this Time Warner , trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time . '' ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony . ### `` From the beginning , -LCB- they -RCB- knew we had a goal and a dream , '' says Mr. Guber . ### On a number of occasions , he adds , he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright . ### `` They always listened , but they never acted , '' Mr. Guber says . ### In 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman . ### In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of . ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio , and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros . ' President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal . ### But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later . ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price . ### Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter . ### Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co . ### Meanwhile , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract . ### The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom . ### But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50 million in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million for each . ### The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $ 50 million . ### Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner . ### Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last year . ### And earnings have been erratic . ### In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter . ### Guber Peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16.625 . ### The two sides now are accusing each other of lying . ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise . ### But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made . ### Warner , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . '' ### Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different . ### For one thing , according to Mr. Daly , the producers requested a release in advance . ### Moreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now . ### Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives , '' Mr. Daly said in his affidavit . ### Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia . ### At the very least , Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony . ### During settlement talks , for example , Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks . ### In any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman . '' ### Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner . ### And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts . ### The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief , they note , Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract , then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia . ### In his affidavit filed yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument : `` If Sony succeeds here , no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on . ### THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better . ### First , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities . '' ### Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing . ### And there 's more . ### The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions . ### Most earn high ratings from credit agencies . ### Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues . ### And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors . ### Ready to jump ? ### Well , think twice . ### The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors . ### But the simplicity may be misleading . ### Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk . ### They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate . ### Moreover , the securities were introduced only about 4 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession . ### `` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says Owen Carney , director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency . ### `` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . '' ### Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products . ### Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities . ### They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans . ### They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares . ### Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders . ### Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations . ### And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds . '' ### `` This is the heyday of debt , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , a newsletter . ### `` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . '' ### The result is a $ 45 billion market , according to Securities Data Co . ### That includes more than $ 9.5 billion issued through August of this year , up sharply from $ 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987 . ### Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions . ### But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market . ### The entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 . ### `` We expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors , says Bill Addiss , a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . ### The process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust . ### The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors . ### Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings . ### Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions . ### Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says Craig J. Goldberg , managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . ### But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks . ### Consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables . ### The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues . ### On a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year . ### That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street . ### But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless . ### `` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis points -LRB- 0.25 percentage point -RRB- becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant . ### `` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' ### Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . ### That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California . ### But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . ### He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts . ### Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash . ### The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues . ### That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . ### That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . ### `` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice president of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . ### In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . ### There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities . ### Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem . ### Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities . ### It is n't . ### The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof . '' ### In other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue . ### The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency . ### That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received . ### That also is n't easy . ### Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company . ### The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities . ### Nor does it cover the entire portfolio . ### Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue . ### Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim . ### But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper . ### When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties . ### If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports . ### Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions . ### But despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets . ### At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times . ### At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys . ### That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter . ### But it could be much worse . ### Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues . ### For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured . ### In addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession . ### `` A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds , '' says Craig Corcoran of Futures Inc. , an investment advisory firm . ### What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues ? ### `` Nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys , '' Mr. Corcoran replies . ### Ratings , he notes , `` are subject to change . '' ### All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people . ### And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what he calls `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 : ### `` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time . '' ### Mr. Herman is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . ### Volume of asset-backed securities issued annually ### As of August 30 ### Source : Securities Data Co . ### IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : Diversify . ### Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. , serious investors have taken that advice to heart . ### Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios . ### Those portfolios are remarkably diversified . ### By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate . ### For example , about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock -LRB- down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year -RRB- . ### But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market . ### Similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds . ### But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives . ### The poll , conducted Aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics . ### It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . ### Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . ### The response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . ### The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though . ### Journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 . ### Nearly half of the respondents -LRB- 47 % -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said it was worth $ 1 million or more . ### The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago . ### For example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months . ### Last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession . ### An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months . ### Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth . ### Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much . ### A slim majority -LRB- 51 % -RRB- think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 . ### Their verdict on real estate is almost the same . ### Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months . ### By contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold . ### Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control . ### Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance . ### Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession . ### For the most part , the changes were `` slight . '' ### The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- about 31 % -RRB- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- about 15 % -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- about 22 % -RRB- . ### A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents . ### Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year . ### Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any . ### But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark . ### About 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said one is `` unlikely . '' ### Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll . ### And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual . ### About 60 % of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks . ### But as of August , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size . ### Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll . ### But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon . ### Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . ### Percent of respondents who have more than 20 % of their portfolio in these investments , by size of portfolio : the next six months , by size of portfolio : ### How respondents rate their portfolio 's risk on a scale of 10 to 10 -LRB- 1 = defensive low risk , 10 = agressive high risk -RRB- , by size of their investment portfolio : ### Respondents ' investments objective now and three years ago , by size of their investment portfolio : ### Do you plan to buy or sell any stock in the next 3-6 months ? ### Percent of investment portfolio that consists of stocks ? ### Number of individual stocks owned : ### Number of stock transactions per year : ### Annual rate of return on investments over the past five years : ### Another stock market crash is : ### Business outlook for the next 12 months : ### Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14 , down 5.3 % from the preceding week 's total of 291,890 tons , Statistics Canada , a federal agency , said . ### The week 's total was down 7.1 % from 297,446 tons a year earlier . ### A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds . ### The cumulative total in 1989 was 12,283,217 tons , up 7.5 % from 11,429,243 tons a year earlier . ### Health Care Property Investors Inc. said it acquired three long-term care facilities and one assisted-living facility in a purchase-and-lease transaction valued at $ 15 million . ### The real estate investment trust said that it leased the three Florida facilities to National Health Care Affiliates Inc. of Buffalo , N.Y . ### Health Care Property holds an interest in 139 facilities in 30 states . ### Moody 's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about $ 75 million of this Chatsworth , Calif. , concern 's convertible subordinated debentures , due 2012 , to Caa from B2 . ### It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives . ### VALLEY National Corp. -- Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about $ 400 million of this bank holding company 's senior debt to B2 from Ba3 . ### Moody 's said it expects Valley National , of Phoenix , Ariz. , to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio , and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets , and from high loan-loss provisions . ### Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage . ### That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage . ### `` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md . ### It `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said Michelle Van Cleave , the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs . ### The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group . ### Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air . ### Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . ### They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . ### `` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . '' ### The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information . ### Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the experts said . ### By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security , and are expected to spend $ 1 billion by 1992 . ### Already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers , conference speakers reported . ### Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy . ### One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies . ### Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory . ### He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read . ### No personal computer , not even the one on a chief executive 's desk , is safe , this speaker noted . ### W. Mark Goode , president of Micronyx Inc. , a Richardson , Texas , firm that makes computer-security products , provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness , known commonly as glasnost . ### Under Mr. Gorbachev , Mr. Goode said , the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications . ### He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East . ### Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company , which had n't been invited to submit a bid . ### The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off , however , because they got the contract . ### The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp . ### The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 21.3 million -RRB- over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker . ### It said $ 10 million would go to the University of Toronto . ### Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$ 866 million for Connaught , and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$ 942 million . ### The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid , arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners . ### The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid . ### It said the new agreement would `` replace '' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover . ### `` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught , this accord would enhance research and development in Canada , '' said James Keffer , the university 's vice president of research . ### Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville , Calif . ### In a statement , Jacques-Francois Martin , director general of Merieux , said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught . ### While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university , he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies `` not currently producing and marketing vaccines -LCB- who -RCB- can only promise this for some... years in the future . '' ### In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Connaught closed at $ 28.625 , up $ 1.25 . ### Microsoft and other software stocks surged , leading the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks to its biggest advance of the year on breathtaking volume . ### Leading the pack , Microsoft soared 3 , or 4 % , to a record price of 84 on 1.2 million shares . ### On the other hand , Valley National tumbled 24 % after reporting a sizable third-quarter loss . ### The Nasdaq composite leaped 7.52 points , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 . ### Its largest previous rise this year came Aug. 7 , when it gained 4.31 . ### The OTC market 's largest stocks soared as well , as the Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 10.01 , or 2 % , to 463.06 . ### The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 5.04 , or 1.1 % , to 460.33 . ### By comparison , the Dow Jones Industrials and the New York Stock Exchange Composite each rose 1.5 % . ### Volume totaled 173.5 million shares , 30 % above this year 's average daily turnover on Nasdaq . ### Among broader Nasdaq industry groups , the utility index gained 18.11 to 761.38 . ### The transportation and insurance sectors each posted gains of 8.59 , with the transports finishing at 486.74 and the insurers at 537.91 . ### The Nasdaq industrial index climbed 8.17 to 458.52 , and the `` other finance '' index , made up of commercial banks and real estate and brokerage firms , rose 3.97 to 545.96 . ### The index of smaller banks improved 1.97 . ### Of the 4,346 issues that changed hands , 1,435 rose and 629 fell . ### Jeremiah Mullins , head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds , said both institutional and retail investors were buying . ### But there was a dearth of sellers , traders said , so buyers had to bid prices up to entice them . ### `` There 's no pressure on OTC stocks at this point , '' said Mr. Mullins , who said some buyers are beginning to shop among smaller OTC issues . ### Microsoft 's surge followed a report this week of substantially improved earnings for its first quarter , ended Sept. 30 . ### The stock was trading at 69 just two weeks ago . ### Rick Sherlund , a Goldman Sachs analyst , has raised his earnings estimates for the company twice in the past two weeks , citing improved margins . ### After the earnings were announced , he raised his fiscal 1990 estimate to between $ 3.80 and $ 4 a share . ### Microsoft earned $ 3.03 a share in fiscal 1989 . ### Among other software issues , Autodesk jumped 1 to 42 , Lotus Development was unchanged at 32 , Novell jumped to 30 , Ashton-Tate gained to 10 , and Oracle Systems rose to 25 . ### Caere , a new software issue , surged from its offering price of 12 to close at 16 . ### The company also makes optical character recognition equipment . ### Caere was underwritten by Alex . Brown & Sons . ### Another recently offered Alex . Brown issue , Rally 's , surged 3 to 23 . ### The operator of fast-food restaurants , whose shares began trading last Friday , climbed 3 to 23 on 944,000 shares . ### Its 1.7 million-share offering was priced at 15 . ### Valley National 's slide of 5 points to 18 on 4.2 million shares followed its report late Wednesday of a $ 72.2 million third-quarter loss . ### In the 1988 quarter , the Phoenix , Ariz. , commercial banking concern earned $ 18.7 million . ### Valley National said its $ 110 million provision for credit losses and $ 11 million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the Arizona real estate market . ### Additionally , Moody 's Investors Service said it downgraded Valley National 's senior debt and confirmed the company 's commercial paper rating of `` not prime . '' ### A new issue , Exabyte , surged 2 from its initial offering price to close at 12 . ### The offering was for about 2.8 million shares of the data storage equipment maker ; more than 2.2 million shares changed hands after trading began . ### Dell Computer dropped to 6 . ### The company said earnings for the year ending Jan. 28 , 1990 , are expected to be 25 to 35 cents a share , compared with a previous estimate of 50 to 60 cents a share . ### Nutmeg Industries lost 1 to 14 . ### Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg , Fla. , lowered its third-quarter earnings estimate for the company , according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report . ### A.P. Green Industries advanced 1 to 36 . ### East Rock Partners , which has indicated it might make a bid for the company , said A.P. Green , a refractory products maker , told the partnership it is n't for sale . ### Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch , only a few steps from the very top of the stands . ### From my orange seat , I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series . ### It was five in the afternoon , but that was Pacific time . ### Back in New York the work day was already over , so I did n't have to feel guilty . ### Even still , I did feel self-indulgent , and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons . ### This ballpark , the Stick , was not a classic baseball stadium -- too symmetrical , too much bald concrete . ### And it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium . ### But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the future , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event . ### Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history . ### The broadcasters were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick . ### Why not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it ? ### The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history . ### Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks . ### Thousands of us had paid $ 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia , its historical photographs of great moments in Series past , and its instructions , in English and Spanish , for filling in the scorecard . ### Pitcher = lanzador . ### Homerun = jonron . ### Players ran out on the field way below , and the stands began to reverberate . ### It must be a local custom , I thought , stamping feet to welcome the team . ### But then the noise turned into a roar . ### And no one was shouting . ### No one around me was saying anything . ### Because we all were busy riding a wave . ### Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall , waiting for the wipeout . ### Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on . ### Then I remembered the quake of '71 '71 , which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room . ### When the swaying of the building woke me up , I reasoned that a -RRB- I was in Southern California ; b -RRB- the bed was moving ; c -RRB- it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited . ### Then I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened . ### What should I do ? ### Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot . ### But the lot might split into crevasses , so I had better stand on my car , which probably was wider than the average crevasse . ### Fortunately , the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood . ### At the Stick , while the world shook , I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different . ### If I survived , I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish . ### I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment . ### What was my angle ? ### How would I file ? ### All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration . ### The rest is , of course , history . ### The Stick did n't fall . ### The real tragedies occurred elsewhere , as we soon found out . ### But for a few minutes there , relief abounded . ### A young mother found her boy , who had been out buying a hotdog . ### The wall behind me was slightly deformed , but the center had held . ### And most of us waited for a while for the game to start . ### Then we began to file out , to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch . ### It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen . ### The crowd moved in clumps , clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus . ### In this way , while the Stick itself was blacked out , we kept up to date on events . ### Within 15 minutes of the quake itself , I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge . ### Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car . ### And by then , expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon . ### Darkness fell . ### But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night , with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district . ### By then , our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers . ### Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant . ### In fact , the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience . ### The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters . ### The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway . ### The tape was on tv before the night was out . ### Marshall McLuhan , you should have been there at that hour . ### Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions . ### The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank , except for the page numbers . ### Rather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . ### The plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . ### In fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week . ### Shearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department . ### The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages . ### Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that `` the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance . '' ### Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views . ### But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish . ### Instead , he says , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver '' on Monday . ### As Mr. Rivkin explains it , `` We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market . ### And by late Friday afternoon , actually after the close , we decided that was the wrong tone to take . ### With the market down , we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening . '' ### Both before and after the Friday plunge , Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash . ### Sheldon B. Lubar , chairman of Lubar & Co. , and John L. Murray , chairman of Universal Foods Corp. , were elected to the board of this engine maker . ### They succeed Robert W. Kasten and John R. Parker , who reached the mandatory retirement age . ### China 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall . ### In a report on China 's foundering economy , the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier-the lowest growth rate in a decade for September . ### Retail sales are plummeting , while consumer prices still are rising . ### Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation . ### `` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an Asian economist in Beijing . ### `` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . '' ### A lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers . ### Experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit . ### Unless the government suddenly reverses course , wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest . ### The economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation . ### Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 , while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % . -RRB- ### The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week . ### In Western , market-driven countries , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency . ### In China , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state . ### Instead , China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises , which ate up $ 18 billion in bailouts last year . ### Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt . ### Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership . ### `` When the going gets rough , China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist . ### Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks . ### The meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years . ### But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy . ### Some analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit . ### That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital . ### A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse . ### One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China , the central bank , to allocate $ 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official China Daily reported . ### But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation . ### The cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 . ### And , because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say . ### The statistical bureau 's report , cited in China Daily , notes that industrial output in September totaled $ 29.4 billion , a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier . ### Output declined in several provinces , including Jiangsu and Zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and Sichuan , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket . ### Production in Shanghai , China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8 % for the month . ### Nationwide , output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % -- `` the first decline in 10 years , '' a bureau spokesman told China Daily . ### In an unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods . ### `` This will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the spokesman said . ### The 1986 tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill . ### Real-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules . ### Charitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions . ### Big auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes . ### And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit . ### `` Everything is up for grabs , '' says Theodore Groom , a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies . ### Adds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' ### The catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . ### Other fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . ### The House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . ### The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . ### As part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB- calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . ### The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . ### To be sure , the full Senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill . ### But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary . ### Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions . ### `` There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 '86 code has been given a mighty tug , '' says Rep. Thomas Downey -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- . ### `` You 'll see the annual unraveling of it . '' ### `` It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few , '' says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania , the third-ranking Democrat in the House . ### Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees , he adds , `` Next year , every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door , on Danny Rostenkowski 's door . '' ### Many groups are n't waiting that long . ### Just last week , a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities , companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes . ### `` It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good , '' commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings . ### Even lobbyists for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill , are encouraged . ### The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation -LRB- write-offs -RRB- or investment credits , '' says Paul Huard , a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers . ### Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve `` competitiveness . '' ### In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train . ### Real-estate interests , for example , are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal : It does n't include real-estate gains . ### `` If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains , they certainly want to be part of it , '' says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates . ### In the House-passed tax bill , Mr. Thevenot got his wish ; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision . ### But Sotheby 's , Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs . ### They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment . ### `` Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets , '' the letter states . ### All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 . ### In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . ### The goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . ### Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . ### Many other tax benefits also were swept away . ### This year Congress , with prodding from President Bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code . ### It appears likely that , this year or next , some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted . ### Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created . ### The main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them . ### `` The '86 '86 act was a fluke . ### They wanted reform and they got a revolution , '' says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison -LRB- R. , Ohio -RRB- . ### So , is the tax code now open game again ? ### Mr. Juliano thinks so . ### One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School . ### `` I 'm too old to waste a weekend , but that 's what I did , '' the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans . ### `` These days , anything can happen . ### Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period . ### The West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago . ### Load factor , or percentage of seats filled , climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % , even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters . ### From January through September , the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier , the company added . ### Raymond Chandler , in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book , likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher . ### When the champ has lost his stuff , the great mystery novelist wrote , `` when he can no longer throw the high hard one , he throws his heart instead . ### He throws something . ### He does n't just walk off the mound and weep . '' ### Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career . ### His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe , the inferior `` Playback '' -LRB- 1958 -RRB- , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work . ### When he died in 1959 , Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book , `` The Poodle Springs Story , '' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque . ### `` Champ '' Chandler 's last pitch , apparently , was a screwball . ### Now Robert Parker , author of several best sellers featuring Spenser , a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold , has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete `` The Poodle Springs Story . '' ### The result , `` Poodle Springs '' -LRB- Putnam 's , 288 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is an entertaining , easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle , full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color . ### If it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic -- well , at the end , neither did Chandler . ### As the book begins , a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle -LRB- a.k.a . Palm -RRB- Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood . ### His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring , a character who also appeared in Chandler 's `` The Long Goodbye '' and `` Playback . '' ### Philip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other , even in front of the houseman . ### But the lovebirds have a conflict . ### He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye , and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him . ### That 's Chandler 's setup . ### Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life , Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds . ### The supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes . ### The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down . ### All told , Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect . ### But there are grounds for complaint . ### At one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro . ### More bothersome , there are several apparent anachronisms . ### Contact lenses , tank tops , prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s . ### A little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable . ### Mr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los Angeles Magazine . ### Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader 's Digest . ### `` Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news , '' says Mr. Shioya . ### `` But one gets fed up with importing information and news . '' ### Mr. Shioya has turned the tables . ### Today , he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine , the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business . ### After a slick redesign , the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company , Keizaikai Corp. , the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services , book publishing and a tourist agency . ### Printed in the U.S. and carrying the line `` The Insider 's Japan , '' Business Tokyo 's October cover story was `` The World 's No. 1 Customer '' -- Japanese women . ### Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing , after making major investments in entertainment , real estate and banking companies here . ### Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market , including the New York-based investment banker Veronis , Suhler & Associates . ### And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups . ### `` Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries , '' said John Veronis , chairman of Veronis Suhler . ### While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent $ 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size . ### `` The Japanese take the long view ''. said Mr. Veronis . ### `` It may not be weeks or months , but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable , they will move on a deal , '' he said . ### In recent months , three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including Nikkei Business Publications , Nikkei Home -LRB- no relation -RRB- , and Magazine House -- applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America , which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines . ### Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers . ### When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 , it appealed to a more multinational audience . ### The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard , and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers . ### American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling . ### Susumu Ohara , president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. , publisher of the Japan Economic Journal , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine . ### `` The Japanese are in the early stage right now , '' said Thomas Kenney , a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group . ### `` Before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft . ### Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise . ### Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter , while Nynex Corp. , Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period . ### Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit . ### Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % , noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit . ### Revenue dropped 4.3 % to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.4 billion , reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector , long-distance carrier business and diversified division . ### Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to $ 618.9 million from $ 599.4 million a year ago . ### New telephone lines posted healthy growth . ### Overall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million , putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time . ### Business lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million . ### `` On a truly comparable basis , we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company , '' said Jack MacAllister , chairman and chief executive officer . ### `` The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years . '' ### He said the company expects to be `` on target '' with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents `` a significant challenge . '' ### Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to $ 664.3 million from $ 747.7 million a year ago . ### Yesterday , U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at $ 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . ### Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % , aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines . ### Revenue jumped 5.6 % to $ 2.9 billion from $ 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter . ### Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to $ 177.4 million from $ 144.1 million a year ago . ### Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4 % to $ 618.6 million . ### Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million . ### The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans . ### In composite trading on the Big Board , Bell Atlantic closed at $ 100.625 , up $ 1.50 a share . ### At Nynex , net slumped 14.8 % , primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees , lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs . ### State and local taxes increased to $ 131.3 million from $ 99.1 million a year ago . ### Nynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.61 billion , a $ 119 million increase . ### Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units , it added . ### `` Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point , '' said William C. Ferguson , chairman and chief executive officer . ### `` This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone . '' ### Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition , particularly in the private-line market , took a heavy toll on earnings . ### The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter . ### Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter , which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines . ### Revenue rose to $ 3.31 billion from $ 3.18 billion , mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses . ### In Big Board composite trading yesterday , Nynex common closed at $ 81.125 , up $ 1.625 . ### Southern New England Telecommunications , which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries , reported that net increased 8.1 % . ### Walter H. Monteith Jr. , SNET chairman and chief executive officer , said : `` Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue . '' ### Revenue and sales increased 7.5 % to $ 423.9 million from $ 394.4 million a year earlier . ### Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8 % to $ 41.2 million . ### Cost and expenses for the quarter , excluding interest , increased 6.1 % to $ 333.3 million from $ 314 million the year before . ### SNET common rose $ 1.25 to $ 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board . ### San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % , primarily because of regulatory action . ### Revenue was about flat at $ 2.4 billion . ### Revenue was reduced $ 33 million by three extraordinary items : a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment ; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies . ### Excluding the one-time charges , the company would have posted earnings of $ 298 million , or 73 cents a share . ### The company also was hurt by a $ 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989 . ### `` This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals , '' said Sam Ginn , chairman and chief executive officer . ### Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about $ 13.5 million for the quarter ; toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion . ### In Big Board composite trading yesterday , Pacific Telesis common closed at $ 45.50 , up 87.5 cents . ### a-Includes a one-time gain of $ 88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West 's U S West New Vector Group . ### b-Includes a $ 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom . ### Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to $ 336 million , or 65 cents a share , as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level . ### A charge of $ 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results . ### A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible . ### In the 1988 third quarter , the Chicago-based oil company earned $ 552 million , or $ 1.07 a share . ### Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to $ 6.6 billion from $ 5.91 billion . ### Aside from the special charge , Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates . ### The company 's stock ended at $ 48.375 , up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . ### Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results . ### Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern . ### Generally in the quarter , overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability . ### The industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices . ### Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter , some industry officials say , but they believe chemical margins could worsen . ### American Petrofina Inc. , a Dallas-based integrated oil company , yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half . ### Fina blamed lower chemical prices , reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns . ### It said net income dropped to $ 15.1 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 35.2 million , or $ 2.66 a share . ### Sales rose 2.2 % to $ 711.9 million from $ 696.1 million . ### Amoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $ 134 million from $ 319 million . ### Chemical earnings declined by one-third to $ 120 million last year 's robust levels . ### Amoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $ 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $ 5 million , `` primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices , '' said Chairman Richard M. Morrow . ### Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output , part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year . ### But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply , to $ 12 million from $ 95 million . ### Higher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly $ 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses . ### For the nine months , Amoco said that net income fell to $ 1.29 billion from $ 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded , operations produced essentially flat results . ### Revenue rose 12 % to $ 19.93 billion from $ 17.73 billion . ### James F. Gero , former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. , and Richard J. Hatchett III , a Dallas investment banker , were elected directors of this medical-products concern , boosting the board to seven members . ### For retailers , Christmas , not Halloween , promises to be this year 's spookiest season . ### Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales . ### Concerns about the stock market , doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators . ### `` Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer , '' asserts Norman Abramson , president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. , an off-price chain . ### Even if there is n't any widespread discounting , the outlook for industry profits is n't good . ### Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year , after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 . ### `` For the last two and a half years , retailing has been in a mild recession , '' says Carl Steidtmann , chief economist at the Columbus , Ohio , consulting firm . ### This year , many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil : Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code ; B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block ; Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block . ### Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance . ### Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. , May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. , which should do well . ### `` There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers , '' says Cynthia Turk , a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant . ### Says Mr. Steidtmann : `` I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas . '' ### Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5 % to 6 % from year-ago figures . ### But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % . ### Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8 % , he believes , as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy . ### Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales . ### Catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year , particularly in December . ### More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date . ### `` Traditionally , consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas , '' says Adam Strum , chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc. , which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail . ### Using Federal Express delivery last year , Mr. Strum says , `` December was our biggest month . '' ### Even Sears , Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act , offering for the first time to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog . ### K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as `` not troublesome . '' ### He 's not predicting a blockbuster , but he is `` more optimistic than three months ago '' because employment remains strong and inflation low . ### Other retailers are also preparing for a ho-hum holiday . ### Philip M. Hawley , chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. , expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3 % to 5 % over last year 's totals , both for his company and the industry in general . ### `` I 'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all , '' he says . ### `` It is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes , '' says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells , `` but it is n't going to be a bust either . '' ### Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise `` pretty much in line '' with its year-to-date increases of between 8 % and 9 % . ### The estimate includes the results of new stores . ###
