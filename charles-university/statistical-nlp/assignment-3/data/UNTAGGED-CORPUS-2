on behalf of the syndicates . ### It could take six months for a claim to be paid . ### `` The system , '' says Nicholas Samengo-Turner , a Lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in 1985 , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . '' ### Some maintain underwriters also have been inept . ### John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 . ### `` How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he says . ### Lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter . ### More recently , property rates have increased . ### Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further . ### But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters . ### The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims . ### Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 . ### That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims . ### But Mr. Lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be . ### Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses -LRB- including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo . ### Lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion . ### Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names . ### Meanwhile , the exchange has been trying to lower costs . ### It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB- ### But Lloyd 's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology . ### Mr. Wetherell , the underwriter , reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least 10 % . ### Though Lloyd 's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions , the effort has n't gotten very far . ### Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information . ### Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings , even for routine policies . ### Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies . ### Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers . ### Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada . ### But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented . ### The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand . ### Lloyd 's is moving forward on some fronts , though . ### Mr. Lawrence says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims . ### By next year , all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims . ### Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president . ### Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman . ### Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm . ### In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one . ### The title of chief executive officer is n't used . ### While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many . ### It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president . ### Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing . ### Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms . ### As of March 31 , the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen -LRB- $ 5.64 billion -RRB- . ### For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated -LRB- parent company -RRB- net income of 79.03 billion yen -LRB- $ 556.5 million -RRB- on revenue of 332.38 billion yen -LRB- $ 2.34 billion -RRB- . ### Both figures were record highs . ### Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition . ### All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. , the world 's largest , Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. , Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets . ### While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S . ### American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities . ### And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors . ### At the same time , Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors . ### Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand . ### When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors . ### `` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit . ### But not a single piece of paper was sold . '' ### By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds . ### In an interview a few months ago , he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues . ### But he could n't sell any . ### Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds ? ### Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said . ### Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing . ### Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled . ### Undaunted , Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it . '' ### He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions . ### Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors . ### Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 . ### Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual investors . ### In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations . ### `` He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said Takuro Isoda , chairman of Daiwa 's U.S. unit in New York . ### But it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency . ### Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies ' earnings . ### And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force `` would be fragile , '' said a Daiwa executive . ### If Mr. Dozen has a weakness , it may be his golf game . ### `` He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , '' said Mr. Yoneyama . ### Inco Ltd. posted a 35 % decline in third-quarter net income , a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations . ### The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding . ### Inco shares fell after the announcements . ### Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend . ### Inco closed at $ 31.125 a share , down 62.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . ### Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year . ### The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3 . ### Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier . ### Sales rose 8.2 % to $ 848.7 million from $ 784.5 million . ### Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share . ### Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore . ### Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable . ### Under a previous buyback program , Inco has purchased 1.7 million of its shares since April . ### UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now . ### As a result , UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company . ### The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility . ### The effort to create the nation 's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion offer . ### Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support . ### Takeover stock traders , focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news . ### UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement . ### Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 . ### The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal . ### Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid . ### But the board said it was n't interested for now . ### That proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands . ### The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan . ### And , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it . ### The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . '' ### But it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy . ### The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . '' ### Mr. Wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline . ### He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . '' ### But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again . ### Labor problems top the list . ### For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United 's pilot union . ### In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted . ### That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out . ### As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft . ### It 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement . ### The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . '' ### The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions . ### The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction . ### The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union . ### The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out . ### They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost . ### His credibility is also on the line in the investment community . ### Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines . ### But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options . ### The board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer . ### It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits . ### Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value . ### One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote . ### The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees . ### Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline . ### However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential UAL data . ### Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share . ### Tandy Corp. said it wo n't join U.S. Memories , the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips . ### Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories . ### Last month , Apple Computer Inc. said that it would n't invest in the group . ### Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development . ### U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the Japanese . ### Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips . ### Tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor . ### `` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning . ### Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage U.S. Memories ' failure . ### `` I would like to have had them , '' he said . ### But `` they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it . '' ### Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp . ### Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably late this week . ### U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join . ### But so far , most potential participants have n't decided . ### Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week . ### American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories ' business plan . ### Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation . ### A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration . ### In a startling turnabout , Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them . ### David Boren , the Intelligence Committee chairman , is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination . ### With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service . ### If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the American people ought to know . ### What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry . ### Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity . ### But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue . ### And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy , it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too . ### The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega . ### When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads . ### The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity . ### But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress ? ### For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ? ### What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops ? ### Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol . ### Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning : You have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you . ### Or maybe a Surgeon General 's warning : Confiding in the United States may be fatal . ### CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup . ### The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point . ### `` The interpretation '' of the executive order , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . '' ### In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA . ### The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter . ### And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties . ### Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North . ### The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . '' ### No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it . ### What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ? ### Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play ? ### The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action . ### President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security . ### There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars . ### The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed . ### In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility . ### The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral . ### As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi . ### It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal . ### Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him . ### We 've heard California 's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years , but ABC 's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance . ### Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes . ### Both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years , even while the price of gasoline has fallen . ### Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch . ### A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here , injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the Houston Ship Channel . ### There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night . ### The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air . ### One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors . ### Glenn Cox , Phillips ' president and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions . ### In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 . ### The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast . ### The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area . ### The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo . ### Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control . ### The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school . ### The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away . ### Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise . ### The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said . ### The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts . ### The number working at the time of the blast was n't known . ### Yesterday 's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant . ### In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house . ### The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene , polypropylene and K-resin , plastics used in a wide array of applications , including milk jugs and toys . ### Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips ' chemicals operations , which is the biggest single contributor to the company 's profits . ### A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $ 250,000 , representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . ### Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law . ### Joseph Lombardo , who the government alleged was the `` captain '' of organized crime in Chicago , was one of numerous defendants in the government 's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters . ### In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering . ### Among other things , the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union 's top officials . ### U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union . ### Mr. Lombardo , the last of the defendants to settle the suit , agreed to pay the government the $ 250,000 within one week . ### Exxon Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 9 % as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged . ### All cleanup costs from last spring 's Alaskan oil spill were reflected in earlier results , it said . ### Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. also reported declines in quarterly profit , while Ashland Oil Inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter . ### Amerada Hess Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported higher earnings . ### Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill , those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $ 880 million in charges taken during the first half . ### An Exxon official said that at this time the oil company does n't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil spilled when one of its tankers rammed into an underwater reef . ### She added , however , that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill . ### She said that impact ca n't be reasonably assessed yet . ### Exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ 1.11 billion , or 87 cents a share , from $ 1.22 billion , or 93 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue rose 8.1 % , to $ 23.65 billion from $ 21.88 billion . ### During the third quarter , Exxon purchased 8.34 million shares of its stock at a cost of $ 373 million . ### Exxon 's profitability , like that of many other oil companies , was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses . ### Exxon 's earnings from chemicals operations fell $ 90 million , to $ 254 million , while refining and marketing profits declined $ 180 million , to $ 357 million . ### Although crude oil prices were significantly higher this year , they were n't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business sectors at most oil companies , said William Randol , oil analyst for First Boston Corp . ### He estimates that the price of West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , was $ 4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year . ### A rash of one-time charges left Ashland Oil with a loss of $ 39 million for its fiscal fourth quarter . ### A year earlier , the refiner earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share . ### Quarterly revenue rose 4.5 % , to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.2 billion . ### For the year , net income tumbled 61 % to $ 86 million , or $ 1.55 a share . ### The Ashland , Ky. , oil company reported a $ 38 million charge resulting from settlement of a 10-year dispute with the National Iranian Oil Co. over claims that Ashland did n't pay for Iranian crude it had received . ### In September , Ashland settled the long-simmering dispute by agreeing to pay Iran $ 325 million . ### Ashland also took a $ 25 million after-tax charge to cover anticipated costs to correct problems with boilers built by one of its subsidiaries . ### The oil refiner also booked a $ 15 million charge for selling Ashland Technology Corp. , one of its subsidiaries , at a loss . ### Third-quarter earnings at Amerada Hess more than tripled to $ 51.81 million , or 64 cents a share , from $ 15.7 million , or 20 cents a share , a year earlier . ### Revenue climbed 28 % , to $ 1.18 billion from $ 925 million . ### Profits improved across Hess 's businesses . ### Refining and marketing earnings climbed to $ 33.3 million from $ 12.9 million , and exploration and production earnings rose to $ 37.1 million from $ 17.9 million . ### Hess 's earnings were up despite a $ 30 million charge to cover the cost of maintaining operations after Hurricane Hugo heavily damaged the company 's refinery at St. Croix . ### It is widely known within industry circles that Hess had to buy oil products in the high-priced spot markets to continue

### Revenue rose 6.9 % , to $ 3.1 billion from $ 2.9 billion . ### Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline , said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement . ### Despite higher oil prices , exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of Phillips ' North Sea oil fields . ### A year ago , results were buoyed by a $ 20 million after-tax gain from an asset sale . ### Occidental Petroleum 's third-quarter net income rose 2.9 % to $ 108 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ 105 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier . ### The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $ 71 million from non-recurring items . ### Sales dropped 2 % , to $ 4.8 billion from $ 4.9 billion . ### The latest period included a $ 54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties , a $ 22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental 's domestic oil and gas operations , and tax credits of $ 42 million . ### Both periods included non-recurring charges of $ 3 million for early retirement of debt . ### Occidental said oil and gas earnings fell to $ 17 million from $ 20 million . ### The latest period includes net gains of $ 32 million in non-recurring credits from the sale of properties , indicating operating losses for the quarter in the oil and gas division . ### Chemical earnings fell 10 % , reflecting softening of demand . ### Citing its reduced ownership in the Lyondell Petrochemical Co. , Atlantic Richfield reported that net income slid 3.1 % in the third quarter to $ 379 million , or $ 2.19 a share , from $ 391 million , or $ 2.17 a share , for the comparable period last year . ### Sales fell 20 % , to $ 3.7 billion from $ 4.6 billion . ### Arco 's earnings from its 49.9 % stake in Lyondell fell to $ 37 million from $ 156 million for the same period last year , when Lyondell was wholly owned . ### Offsetting the lower stake in Lyondell were higher crude oil prices , increased natural gas volumes and higher coke prices , the company said . ### Coal earnings rose to $ 26 million from $ 21 million . ### For the nine months , Arco reported net income of $ 1.6 billion , or $ 8.87 a share , up 33 % from $ 1.2 billion or $ 6.56 a share a year earlier . ### Sales were $ 12 billion , off 13 % from $ 13.8 billion . ### Jeff Rowe contributed to this article . ### The following were among yesterday 's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : ### Imo Industries Inc. -- $ 150 million of senior subordinated debentures due 2001 , priced at par to yield 12 % . ### The issue will be sold through Morgan Stanley & Co . ### Other details were n't available . ### San Antonio , Texas -- $ 575 million of electric and gas system revenue refunding bonds , Series 1989 , 1989A and 1989B , tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group to yield from 6.15 % in 1991 to 7.30 % in 2009 . ### The issue includes current interest bonds due 1991-2000 , 2009 , 2012 , 2014 and 2016 , and capital appreciation bonds due 2001-2005 . ### The current interest serial bonds are priced to yield from 6.15 % in 1991 to 7.10 % in 2000 . ### There are about $ 100 million of 7 % term bonds due 2009 , priced to yield 7.30 % , which is the issue 's high yield . ### There are also about $ 124 million of 6 % bonds priced to yield 7.25 % in 2012 ;

's National Broadcasting Co . ### The premiere of `` Showdown , '' with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter , a columnist with the New York Daily News , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m . ### CNBC is available to 13 million cable households . ### Mr. Downey said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive . ### But I 'm going to proceed in a more logical way . ### I 'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone 's home . ### But that does n't mean I 'm not going to get angry . '' ### Michael Eskridge , president of CNBC , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` Mort Mort Mort '' But just how does Mr. Downey 's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of CNBC 's business programming ? ### `` Ninety percent of Mort 's old show fits into our style , '' said Mr. Eskridge . ### That is consumer issues . '' ### Mr. Downey 's previous show , a one-hour shout fest , syndciated by MCA Inc. and produced by Quantum Media Inc. , was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it . ### Investors dumped stocks of big companies whose earnings fluctuate with the economy . ### Many of those `` cyclical '' issues are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which fell 26.23 to 2662.91 . ### Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced advancers , 1,012 to 501 . ### Recession fears are springing up again among investors . ### Analysts say that the selling of cyclical stocks yesterday will be followed by a sell-off in shares of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets . ### In an economic slowdown , heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of companies because cash that would normally be used to keep the company buoyant must be diverted to interest payments . ### On the other hand , investors beat a clear path yesterday to blue-chip issues with proven earnings growth records . ### Among the 30 Dow industrials , they bought McDonald 's , Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble and sold Aluminum Co. of America . ### In another sign of slowdown fears , investors dumped technology shares . ### Many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets . ### `` The junk bond market is being taken apart '' because of recession fears , said J. David Mills , senior vice president at Boston Company Advisers . ### Under this scrutiny , the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies . '' ### In fact , much of the buying in blue chips yesterday was a pursuit of companies with lower debt levels . ### In a recent investment letter entitled `` Winners of the ` Leverage Wars , ' `` Edward Kerschner , chairman of PaineWebber 's investment policy committee , suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt . ### `` We 're saying companies have to pay increasing attention to balance sheets , '' said Mr. Kerschner . ### He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea , J. Baker , McDonald 's , Philip Morris and Sara Lee . ### He said that all of these companies will be able to compete fiercely in an economic downturn . ### McDonald 's has long-term debt equaling 91 % of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $ 2.6 billion below their real value . ### Coca-Cola climbed 1 to 72 1 to 31 , and Procter & Gamble gained to 130 . ### A&P fell 1 to 57 , and J. Baker gained to 21 . ### Philip Morris slipped to 43 , while Sara Lee closed unchanged at 60 . ### According to Salomon Brothers ' `` stub '' stock index of 20 companies whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity , investors are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden companies . ### From January to early September , the index of stub stocks -- the tiny portion of equity that 's publicly traded following a recapitalization -- outperformed Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index by about 20 % . ### But starting in early September , the index started to slide and now stands about even with the S&P 500 . ### `` Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk , '' said Eric Sorenson , director of quantitative analysis at Salomon Brothers . ### `` Companies that have the most exposure to the business cycle have underperformed since late last summer . '' ### Union Carbide , whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35 % from a year earlier and fell short of analysts ' expectations , declined to 24 . ### Also , Exxon went down to 45 and Allied-Signal lost to 35 even though the companies ' results for the quarter were in line with forecasts . ### Other weak blue-chip issues included Chevron , which went down 2 to 64 in Big Board composite trading of 1.3 million shares ; Goodyear Tire & Rubber , off 1 to 46 , and American Express , down to 37 . ### Texas Instruments , which had reported Friday that third-quarter earnings fell more than 30 % from the year-ago level , went down 2 to 33 on 1.1 million shares . ### Motorola , another major semiconductor producer , dropped 1 to 57 . ### Pinnacle West Capital , whose earnings have been hurt by continued problems at its MeraBank unit , fell 1 to 9 on 2.1 million shares to lead the Big Board 's list of most active issues . ### Growing pressures on the Arizona real-estate market are affecting the thrift ; Pinnacle West told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it may consider filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if it ca n't reach an agreement with federal regulators to provide additional capital to MeraBank . ### Hercules dropped 2 to 41 on one million shares -- about six times its average daily trading volume -- after a disappointing third-quarter earnings report . ### Merrill Lynch and Prudential-Bache Securities both lowered the stock 's investment rating immediately after the results were issued Friday , according to PIR . ### Elsewhere in the chemicals sector , Dow Chemical fell 1 to 97 1 , to 1 to . ### Other stocks hurt by earnings-related selling included Tandy , which dropped 1 to 44 , and Eaton , which retreated 2 to 57 . ### Third-quarter earnings at both companies were below analysts ' forecasts . ### After declining about 41 % last week , UAL advanced 9 to 178 on 1.1 million shares on anticipation of a revised takeover offer from a labor-management group for the parent company of United Airlines . ### However , Delta Air Lines fell 1 to 67 and USAir Group dropped to 42 . ### Ramada gained to 11 after revamping the terms of its restructuring plan , which calls for the company to sell its hotel operations for $ 540 million and spin off its casino business to shareholders . ### The revision follows last month 's withdrawal of a $ 400 million junk-bond offering for the new casino company , Aztar Corp . ### Mead gained 1 to 37 . ### USA Today reported that the Rales brothers , Washington , D.C.-based investors who made an unsuccessful offer to acquire Interco last year , have bought nearly 3 % of Mead 's common shares . ### Entertainment and media stocks generally escaped the market 's slide as well . ### Paramount Communications rose to 58 , Time Warner climbed 1 to 138 , Walt Disney advanced 3 to 127 1 to 65 and McGraw-Hill added to 67 . ### The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 3.11 to 379.46 . ### Volume totaled 10,450,000 shares . ### Carnival Cruise Lines Class A fell 1 to 20 . ### The company said it had been notified unofficially that Waertsilae Marine Industries , a Finnish shipyard building three cruise ships for the company , is having financial trouble and may already have filed for bankruptcy . ### `` Hacksaw '' and `` Bonecrusher '' are the sort of nicknames normally associated with linebackers and heavyweight contenders . ### Who 'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents ? ### Chicago 's new school chief is the hard-nosed Ted Kimbrough . ### At his old job in Compton , Calif. , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member . ### At his first Chicago press conference , he berated the reporters . ### In New York City , the new Chancellor , Joseph Fernandez , has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform . ### Both men fit the mood of the times -- the mood being one of a public fed up with officials ' rationalizations for why their schools do n't work . ### Former Patterson , N.J. , principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator . ### The subject of the movie `` Lean on Me , '' Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat . ### He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold ? ### Elena Scambio , the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state , says her top priority will be to `` cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy . '' ### Mr. Fernandez does n't take control in New York until January , but already he 's roiling the waters . ### He 's attacked the concept of `` building tenure , '' one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools . ### It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals . ### Once they are in the building , they stay . ### One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work . ### He was finally given leave when he was arrested for allegedly buying crack . ### Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge . ### We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal , toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they 're defending . ### In his old job , as Dade County chief , Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals . ### He cut the dropout rate by 5.5 % . ### But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well ; incompetent principals and administrators should go , but the good ones ought to be left alone . ### The situation will be especially delicate for Mr. Kimbrough . ### He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform . ### Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards , one for each school . ### This of course led to disaster in New York City . ### Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential , but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them . ### The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems . ### The schools ' central mission , educating children , became subsumed by the competing interests of bureaucrats , politicians and unions . ### The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped learning . ### Mr. Chips was a nice fellow , and maybe some day he 'll return . ### Until then , it 's clear that some of the people who 've been keeping big-city schools down are going to be dealing with the Terminator . ### Ingersoll Publications Co. agreed to buy the New Haven Register in a transaction valued at $ 275 million from Goodson Newspaper Group Inc . ### As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently . ### Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun . ### Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 . ### Goodson will pay the additional $ 20 million in settlement of the management contract . ### Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers . ### Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr . ### Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 . ### The New Jersey paper , like the New Haven , Conn. , paper , was purchased by Ingersoll on Goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract . ### Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances . ### Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ 190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers . ### David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers . ### Goodson said David Carr , former president of Ingersoll Publications , and Ray Cockburn , former senior vice president , would head the new in-house management team at Goodson , which had revenue of $ 225 million in 1988 . ### The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll . ### The latter 's son , Ralph Ingersoll Jr. , took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson . ### But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co . ### Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe . ### The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year . ### Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is `` delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship '' and will be able to `` concentrate all our energies '' on Ingersoll 's own papers . ### Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers . ### Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover , Kenneth Roman , Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer , said he is leaving to take a top post at American Express Co . ### Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications . ### He will succeed Harry L. Freeman , 57 , who has said he will retire in December . ### Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra . ### American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra . ### The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him . ### Although Mr. Freeman is retiring , he will continue to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis . ### Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy . ### The agency , under his direction , bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before succumbing in May . ### And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company . ### Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell , a financial man , to cut costs at the agency . ### Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British . ### Alexander Brody , 56 , will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations . ### He had been president of the international operations . ### Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group 's two other units , the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division , but those units will now report directly to WPP . ### Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job . ### Known as a traditional executive , he is very much in the conservative American Express mold . ### Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident . ### He also is close to American Express 's chairman and chief executive officer , James D. Robinson III . ### Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson . ### The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy 's top spot by Mr. Sorrell . ### But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine -LRB- The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client -RRB- . ### He asked me not to resign . ### The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman said . ### Mr. Sorrell , traveling in the Far East , could n't be reached . ### Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September . ### According to industry executives , Peter Sutherland , a former European Community commissioner from Ireland , was also a serious contender for the American Express job . ### Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters . ### After talking on and off for the past four weeks , Mr. Roman said , he agreed to take the job because `` it 's the right time , it 's a terrific opportunity , and I think I leave the company in very strong hands . ### It was my decision , not anyone else 's . '' ### Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips , his successor at Ogilvy . ### The two executives could hardly be more different . ### Mr. Roman comes across as a low-key executive ; Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality . ### During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes . ### Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently , the WPP takeover brought them closer together . ### I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. Sorrell -RCB- as my successor . ### Would I have done all those things successively if I did n't think he was the right guy ? '' Mr. Roman asked . ### He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut . ### Mr. Roman will oversee American Express 's public relations and government affairs , among other things , but he wo n't be involved in its advertising , which is handled by the operating units . ### `` I consider this a second career , '' he said . ### He also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee , made up of the top corporate and operating executives . ### Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy . ### American Express , Kraft General Foods , and Mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency . ### `` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods . ### But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips is n't as well-known to many clients . ### `` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers . ### I do n't know -LCB- Mr. Phillips -RCB- all that well . ### I have n't seen or talked to him in several years . '' ### And some analysts questioned whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills Ogilvy needs to turn the agency around . ### While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House . ### I think -LCB- Mr. Phillips -RCB- is going to need some help . ### I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co . ### Ogilvy & Mather 's top creative executive , Norman Berry , left the agency earlier this year . ### `` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill . ### But other analysts said that having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition . ### `` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert . ### It 's probably a reasonable transition . ### Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York . '' ### Sale of Saatchi Unit Close ### Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi ### Computer Sciences would n't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting , which counsels companies on logistics and supply . ### But David Lord , managing editor of Consultants News , an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. , said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting 's approximately $ 15 million annual revenue . ### Both Saatchi & Saatchi , which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June , and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale . ### Ad Notes . ### NEW ACCOUNT : AmBase Corp. , New York , awarded the ad account for its Home Insurance Co. unit to Biederman , Kelly & Shaffer , New York . ### Billings were n't disclosed . ### Puerto Rico Telephone Co. awarded its $ 3 million account to West Indies & Grey , Grey Advertising 's office in Puerto Rico . ### DIET COKE : Coca-Cola Co. yesterday said singer Elton John signed to appear in an ad for Diet Coke . ### Details of the commercial , which will be part of the brand 's 1990 advertising campaign , were n't disclosed . ### Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars , including George Michael and Whitney Houston , to appear in ads for the diet drink . ### Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to U.S. theaters , too . ### The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters . ### The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels , and `` Treasure Island , '' produced by Charlton Heston , who also stars in the movie . ### Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit . ### In an interview , Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally . ### But he said Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S . ### `` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the U.S. , '' he said , adding that Turner Pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991 . ### Turner has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters . ### Mr. Hogan said `` The Secret Life of Ian Fleming '' and `` Treasure Island '' cost more than $ 6 million each to make , which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release . ### The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films . ### In July , Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters . ### In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte . ### Paribas said that once it receives the go-ahead from French stock market authorities , it will offer to boost its Navigation Mixte stake to 66.7 % from the current 18.7 % . ### Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs -LRB- $ 3.62 billion -RRB- , making this one of France 's largest-ever attempted takeovers . ### The cost of buying the additional 48 % stake would be 10.95 billion francs -LRB- $ 1.74 billion -RRB- . ### The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong . ### It also would make Paribas a major French ally of West Germany 's Allianz AG insurance group . ### Allianz holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago . ### Those include Rhin et Moselle Vie and Via Assurances . ### Long considered a potential takeover target , Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders . ### That idea may have backfired . ### Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral . ### Navigation Mixte said it would n't have any comment until its board meets Wednesday . ### But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend . ### `` The defensive options are limited , '' says Philippe Braye , a partner in portfolio management concern France Finance Quatre . ### Who would bid against Paribas ? '' ### If the Paribas bid succeeds , it will be the second time in two months a big French investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group . ### Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG . ### That complex bid was billed as France 's largest takeover ever -LRB- this one is slightly smaller -RRB- . ### Moreover , Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique . ### Paribas officials , once considered France 's toughest bankers , felt abashed at Suez 's success and its rapid growth . ### Although Paribas denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France 's two largest investment banking groups . ### It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in Europe to keep up as the European Community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992 . ### Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet would n't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte 's insurance operations to Allianz , he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate . ### He also told reporters the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity , bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak . ### Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others . ### And Navigation Mixte has a huge hidden attraction . ### Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs . ### Paribas said it will bid 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend , and 1,800 francs for those created July 1 , which are eligible for partial dividends . ### Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte share . ### Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs , and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid . ### Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it . ### This is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes . ### Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price . ### Mr. Francois-Poncet responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake , striking an alliance with current management . ### When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control . ### He told reporters he had information that Mr. Fournier was preparing to buy as much as 20 % of Paribas , up from less than 5 % currently . ### A bid against Paribas could n't be ruled out . ### France 's second-largest government-owned insurance company , Assurances Generales de France , has been building its own Navigation Mixte stake , currently thought to be between 8 % and 10 % . ### Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached . ### Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said OPEC oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter . ### In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 for December delivery . ### Petroleum products prices also declined . ### Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day . ### That level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong . ### But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further . ### The group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early 1990 . ### With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices . ### Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude , analysts say , now the facility wo n't need any , at a time of already high availability . ### The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products . ### A company official said the explosions began when a seal blew out . ### Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said . ### There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company . ### Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices . ### For instance , one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ 20 a barrel . ### `` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he said . ### In other commodity markets yesterday : COPPER : The selling that started on Friday continued yesterday ### The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 . ### London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons . ### The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in . ### Fund selling also picked up at that point . ### According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts . ### This activity produced small rallies , which in turn attracted new short selling . ### Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market . ### Such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong British pound to buy copper in New York . ### `` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said . ### Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ 1.19 to $ 1.34 . ### Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ 1.04 . ### PRECIOUS METALS : Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments , which use both metals , showed signs of producing extra heat . ### January platinum closed down $ 2.80 an ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day . ### December palladium was off $ 1.55 an ounce at $ 137.20 . ### Platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 . ### Some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report , which will be released today . ### Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters . ### Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt by such stories . ### He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again . ### Also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier , the Soviet Union . ### Many analysts believe that the Soviets ' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much . ### GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news . ### On the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans for November delivery closed at $ 5.63 a bushel , down half a cent , while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 a bushel . ### Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union . ### But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt . ### Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices . ### SUGAR : World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts . ### The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound , down 0.37 cent . ### For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan . ### But with no reports of either country actually entering the market , analysts said , futures prices became vulnerable . ### Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents . ### But Erik Dunlaevy , a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd. , said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler : Speculators , he said , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . '' ### A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country . ### COCOA : Futures rallied modestly . ### The December contract rose $ 33 a metric ton to $ 1,027 , near its high for the day . ### Gill & Duffus Ltd. , a British cocoa-trading house , estimated that the 1989-90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons , down from 314,000 tons for the previous year . ### Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies . ### Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s . ### At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon . ### But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped-up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 level . ### He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move . ### Sandra Kaul , research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton , said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast , a major cocoa producer . ### Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss , a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo . ### The price was 3.6 billion yen -LRB- $ 25 million -RRB- . ### The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai-Goss , which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry . ### The purchase was made by Rockwell Graphic Systems , a Chicago subsidiary of the El Segundo , Calif. , concern . ### Ikegai-Goss , which has about 200 employees , is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology , which reduces time and materials waste when preparing a press for printing . ### The bond market , which sometimes thrives on bad news , cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker . ### Early in the day , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble . ### Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession . ### For example , today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report . ### The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2 % drop in September orders . ### That would follow a 3.9 % advance in August . ### Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower . ### The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 . ### `` Bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' said Joel Marver , chief fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group . ### `` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said . ### The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended about point higher , or up about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % Friday . ### Municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose . ### Prices of high-yield , high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged . ### In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers . ### In the Treasury market , analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news . ### `` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc . ### On the other hand , we have economic news that is -LCB- expected to be -RCB- relatively positive for the bond market . ### We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said . ### Today , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year notes . ### Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds . ### So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds . ### Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction . ### While some say the auction should proceed smoothly , others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ 2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale . ### The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history . ### The company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp . ### The issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company . ### First Boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering . ### The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys . ### The only asset-backed deal larger than Ford 's was a $ 4 billion offering by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986 . ### Treasury bonds were to point higher yesterday in light trading . ### The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 , compared with 101 Friday . ### The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 to yield 7.97 % . ### The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.84 % . ### Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale . ### The Treasury sold $ 7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52 % , the highest since the average of 7.63 % at the auction on Oct. 10 . ### The $ 7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the Oct. 10 auction . ### The rates were up from last week 's auction , when they were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively . ### Here are auction details : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value ### Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . ### The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . ### Both issues are dated Oct. 26 . ### The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 26 , 1990 . ### Investment-grade corporates closed about point higher in quiet trading . ### In the junk bond market , Imo Industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield 12 % . ### Peter Karches , managing director at underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co. , said the issue was oversubscribed . ### `` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said . ### Morgan Stanley is expected to price another junk bond deal , $ 350 million of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc. , next Tuesday . ### In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors . ### In the case of Beatrice , Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $ 200 million portion of the offering . ### Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys . ### Under the new plan being considered , the notes would reset annually at a rate to maintain a market value of 101 . ### Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 % and 13 % . ### Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today 's session . ### The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities . ### Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts . ### Traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks . ### In the mortgage pass-through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in the Treasury market . ### Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 , up ; and Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 , up . ### The Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 8.36 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points . ### A $ 575 million San Antonio , Texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector . ### The refunding issue , which had been in the wings for two months , was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation . ### But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off to up point . ### An official with lead underwriter First Boston said orders for the San Antonio bonds were `` on the slow side . '' ### He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace . ### In addition , he noted , the issue would normally be the type purchased by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake , have stretched insurers ' resources and damped their demand for bonds . ### A $ 137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start . ### The issue was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley . ### Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point . ### Japanese government bonds ended lower after the dollar rose modestly against the yen . ### The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan 's bond market . ### The benchmark No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 95.39 , off 0.28 . ### The yield rose to 5.38 % . ### West German bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading . ### The benchmark 7 % bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6 % notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % . ### British government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading as investors looked ahead to today 's British trade report . ### The benchmark 11 % Treasury bond due rose to 111 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12 % issue of 1995 rose to 103 to yield 11.01 % . ### The croaker 's done gone from the hook -- damn My language sure goes to pot down here on the coast . '' ### The husky blond guide with the Aggie cap twists his face in mock fury . ### I got to get back to school and straighten out my English . '' ### He has two more years at Texas A&M . ### Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas , enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond . ### There have been three days of hot , wind-swept rain , and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout , which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts . ### The little radio fizzes as other boats want to see if we have found any fish -- spotting location is everything in this sport . ### Negative answers crackle back . ### The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships . ### We go from one to the other . ### The sun is hot now though it 's only 8 in the morning . ### The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water . ### We cruise toward another set of pilings . ### The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook . ### Then he casts out . ### Just wait for that tap-tap , that thump-thump . ### It comes real gentle before it pulls . ### Do n't forget , trout have very soft mouths . '' ### The radio queries again . ### `` Pickin ' one or two , '' says the guide , chuckling . ### You can tell they 've got nothin ' . '' ### A pair of black skimmers zig-zag past close to the surface . ### Soon we have our limit of the shimmering fish stippled in rose-gold and black . ### And we are the first back at the dock , where the great blue herons stand waiting by the cleaning benches . ### The guide is young and he knows this business but he wants a different life after college , such as working for IBM and wearing a necktie . ### This must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that is `` undeveloped . '' ### There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby . ### People are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves . ### Texas is big and beautiful and they live here , that 's all . ### Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula -LRB- after the oak , not the game -RRB- which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge . ### It is famous as the winter home of the whooping crane , that symbol of the destruction of wild America . ### Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake thinking that it was a snow goose . ### He paid an immense fine and was lucky , according to a local wag , to escape the gas chamber . ### The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see . ### Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies . ### Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills . ### Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky-brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat . ### Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called Tivoli , with a white church , a gas station and a grocery , the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts . ### `` Tivoli Motel , '' I read a sign in the usual pronunciation of the name as we whoosh through . ### `` Here in south Texas we say Tie-vole-ee , '' my host gently corrects . ### Mr. King is the director of the Foreign Press Center in New York . ### AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January . ### The two West German electronics concerns said they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. to merge their activities in the field . ### AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture . ### The joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks -LRB- $ 26.9 million -RRB- and 700 employees . ### It will develop , produce and market high-performance electronic parts . ### Siemens is West Germany 's largest electronics group . ### AEG is 80 % owned by Daimler-Benz AG , the country 's biggest industrial concern . ### Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27 % to $ 29.6 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 40.7 million , or $ 1 a share , a year earlier . ### Sales dropped 4 % to $ 1.12 billion from $ 1.17 billion . ### The company , which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers , said about half the earnings drop came from the `` virtual collapse '' of the Venezuelan auto industry . ### The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year , making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts . ### Dana also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier . ### The company , based in Toledo , Ohio , had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit . ### Mary Anne Sudol , an analyst at Fitch Investors in New York , said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost `` across the board . '' ### Southwood J. Morcott , Dana 's president , said the company 's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength . ### Norimasa Furuta , president of Japan 's Mazda Motor Corp. , said the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with Ford Motor Co. in Europe ahead of the European Community 's 1992 integration . ### Mr. Furuta did n't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference , but said the project would be undertaken with Ford 's European subsidiary . ### A Ford official confirmed in Tokyo that the U.S. motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement . ### At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal . ### At age 19 , she was a Paris sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade . ### It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas . ### Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters . ### And , for Ms. Baker , the ride was far from over . ### Her bare breasts , her dancing , her voice , her beauty and , perhaps most famously , her derriere , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible . ### Bricktop , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's . '' ### Men were a constant complication . ### Baker had lots of them . ### But she did n't trust them and did n't reward trust . ### As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy . ### Her appetite for children also was large . ### She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina . ### She made money , but spent more . ### Friends pitched in . ### Finally , Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco . ### Another lifelong complication , as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' -LRB- Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- , was racism . ### Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic . ### African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks . ### To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world . ### Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white audiences -RRB- . ### Paris loved her at first sight . ### `` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately . ### `` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. Rose writes . ### Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous . ### `` Jazz Cleopatra '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works . ### It is easy to see why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage . ### Still , even the title raises questions about the author 's vision of her subject . ### Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term . ### To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with Cleopatra , requires an equal stretch . ### Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life . ### In fact , Ms. Baker played scenes in Casablanca that could have made it into `` Casablanca . '' ### During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens . ### She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France . ### In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' to drown out the Nazis . ### The night the Germans occupied all of France , Baker performed in Casablanca . ### The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai J'ai deux amours '' they wept . ### Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II . ### In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested . ### It does n't help that sometimes Ms. Rose 's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want . ### One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments . '' ### Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer , Ms. Rose writes : `` She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman . '' ### One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond . ### In `` Josephine Baker '' -LRB- Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 -RRB- , which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month , Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star . ### The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw . ### Or ever will . '' ### Mr. Lescaze is foreign editor of the Journal . ### Manville , having rid itself of asbestos , now sells fiberglass , forest products , minerals and industrial goods . ### Heady stuff it 's not . ### But Manville 's ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors . ### The Denver-based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust . ### The trust , which owns 80 % of Manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims . ### When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash . ### But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares . ### Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market . ### `` Their principal asset is Manville common stock , '' says Jeffrey Halis , who runs Sabre Associates , an investment fund that owns Manville shares . ### If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail . ### What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares . '' ### The trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its Manville stock . ### However , the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims . ### Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 . ### The trust also will receive $ 75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from Manville . ### And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income . ### Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch . ### As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each . ### The average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled first -RRB- . ### And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities . ### `` At some point , we 're going to need an infusion of funds , '' a person close to the trust says . ### Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock . ### It does n't pay a dividend , and this trust needs income . ### Moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in Manville , the trust is badly in need of diversification . ### `` Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , '' the person close to the trust says . ### Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring . ### Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured . ### We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says . ### Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders . ### But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 . ### And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name . ### Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders . ### `` This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders , '' one investor says . ### Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term . ### Its stock , at 9 , trades at about 8 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers . ### Mr. Bullock says 45 % of revenues are tied to construction . ### Analysts predict little or no near-term growth . ### They are , nonetheless , high on
